"I believe that important animal  in my country is Japanese clane, called Nihon-zuru. There are 3 reasons for that.

Firstly, all Japanese citizen recognize that the clane is one of the Japanese traditional birds. The clane is the simbol of happiness forever and luck. That is why we print the Turu on Kimono, especially wedding Kimono pearing tartle. When I saw pictures of my pearents in wedding ceremony, my mom wore a Red Kimono with printed clane in the second her dress. 

Secondly, the birds suit our country seanary. There is a pond and the Nihon-zuru are flying togather, which is very beautiful. That should be Japanese beauty. When I was kids, my pearets took me to the national park. There are some wild Nihon-zuru. They has white color wings and red head. Thier leg are so thin. They looks so elegant.

Thirdly, they are disapearing compearing to the 50 years before. We have to preserve them and thier birth area. Otherwise, we can not see the wild clanes accept zoo. It is very sad that we can not see the seanary like I descrive above.

Conclusion, I think Nihon-zuru is the most important animal in my country. We should consider about environmental problems more for next generation.
