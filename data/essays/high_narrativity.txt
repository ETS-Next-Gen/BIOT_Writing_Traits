" Do we have to move tomorrow on my field trip?""yes said my parents. But why are you finally telling me? We don't know so that morning I went to school and told my friends that I was  moving to a new area ,they asked me the same thing I had asked my parents I grumbled I don't know, but today is my last day lets try to have some fun. Me and my friends just play'd tag,and baseketball, we had a teriffic time .After that it was almost time to go home so then last I told my girlfriend sasha about me moving she had asked me 
why are you finally telling me I said nothing and just look silly like always. She just looked at me sad and walked away. I told my self for anything I won't forget her. It was the end of the day and everybody was giving me moving cards,I threw them all in the trash exspecily Markynn,and Raminezs but I did not throw sasha away and Mrs. Asberry because if I throw away hers she would give me a black eye. School was out and I had told everyone bye and started to walk home like always. soon I had got home my parents had told me that we was only moving nexts door they had said that I will be going to the same school but just next door. I said uhoh
