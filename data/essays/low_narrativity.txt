"Some people think that all 18-year olds should perform one year of national or community services before attending college or a paying job.
I disagree with this proposal.  most people cannot spare the time to engage themselves in community service.  They need jobs that will pay their bills.  Also, people have different objectives and goals for college.  Many students that are majoring in English or Astronomy may find it meaningless to serve community service unless it should be required.
There are many people that may agree  with this proposal as well.  It would be a good reference to put on applications of any kind, but at the same time, if it is not the required experience that a certain college of career position requires , it will not be of much help to that person in the long run.  I think that it should be totally up to the individual  to participate in community service.  It should not be required.  That may cause more people not to attend the college of their choice or to apply to the job position that they desire because of inconvenience.
