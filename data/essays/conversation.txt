Hey, Alicia?

Oh hey, I didn't see you there. Did you already get a table?

Yeah, right over here.

I'm glad we had time to meet up.

Me too. So, what's going on?

Oh, not much. You?

Not much. Hey, how did your interview go? Wasn't that today?

Oh, yeah. I think it went well. I don't know if I got the job yet, but they said they would call in a few days.

Well, I'm sure you did great. Good luck.

Thanks. I'm just happy that it's over. I was really nervous about it.

I can understand that. I get nervous before interviews, too.

Well, thanks for being supportive. I appreciate it.

Sure, no problem.
