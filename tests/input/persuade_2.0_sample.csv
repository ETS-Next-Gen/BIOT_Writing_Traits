Today, most of the society is thoughtless. Especially new drivers, all driver for that matter do not understand the dangers of looking at a cell phone while behind the wheel.

The automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing, teens have been the largest age group that was reported to being distracted by cellular usage. I do not agree with people using their cell phones and driving, humans should be smarter to know that if something is going on while they are driving that is so important then pulling off to the side of the road. The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device.

The ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous.

Within a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense.

Conversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe.

The creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.      ",4,334,Phones and driving,Independent,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

97C1CFD04E4B,"Cell phone use should not be legal while driving, it causes many accidents even fatalities. Drivers become careless while driving when using cell phones. Cell phones cause distractions while on the road. Drivers do not pay attention to the road, which causes accidents to happen. The most prevalent distractions are texting and talking on a cell phone while driving. Cell Phone use should not be legal while driving because it will help prevent more accidents and also prevent more deaths. People become distracted while driving when they use cell phones and bring danger into life, the government should regulate stricter laws to citizens about cell phone use on the road.

Drivers are too busy talking on cell phones and not paying attention to the road. Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. Maybe the driver gets a call, gets into an argument, or they are driving too slow. Also another reason is calling while driving can also block out hearing cause the driver is too focused on who is talking, also the driver is less aware of cars around.

This has a big impact on the economy and death rates in the world.

The next reason cell phone use should be illegal while driving is due to texting. This causes the same risks but at a higher rate because you are constantly looking at your phone. Drivers are too busy focused on their screen to pay attention to the road. They are also too busy thinking about their responses and what to say to pay attention to other drivers on the road. Since it usually takes two hands to text, the driver has no hands on the steering wheel. This distraction causes the most fatalities.

This is just another reason cell phone use while driving should be illegal. Drivers however, underestimate their risks of getting into an accident while using their cell phone on the road. Companies also have this break with reality. They promote things like hand free devices, even though those have been shown not to eliminate the risk of getting into an accident. ""Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.

Overall, they acknowledge these things happen but they still market things that will cause distractions and increase accident risk.

State governments should set stricter rules about cell phone use while driving. Death rates are going up rapidly everyday. More and more people are passing away from others not paying attention to their pathway. People are being less cautious and lose focus while being on the road.

2CE1FE38D0E7,"Phones and Driving

Driving is a good way to get whatever you need to go in a shorter period of time than on foot. Americans like driving from places such as fast food restaurants to appointments or work. As technology advances and people like to accommodate themselves with technology, we also want this same technology with us even in our vehicles. However if someone is driving with a device I think it is dangerous and can cause serious injuries. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it can be a distraction to not only you but others, can cause a car accident, and it can be illegal . If you are not convinced then I'll explain why driving while on your phone is dangerous.

While driving anywhere you need to always focus on who and what is in your nearby surroundings. In fact, according to driving test.org, ¨ texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving under the influence of alcohol¨ . Since the light refracted off the phone is what you are focused on, vehicles or objects approaching would not get your attention. This is especially true when the phone emits a light with a brighter color or image.

Also best case scenario if you do not cause an accident you may even miss your turn or exit all because you were distracted. Worst case scenario you may cause an accident which I will explain next.

Driving while you are on your phone is not only dangerous because it can be distracting but what happens can lead to a car accident. If you do not take the time to focus on the road, your carelessness may harm pedestrians or other drivers. DrivingTest.org says twenty Texting and Driving makes you 23% more likely to be involved in an accident¨ . It then goes on to say that in 2011, 1.3 million automobiles accidents were caused by this and one can only assume that the numbers have gotten higher with technology advancing. A later text mentions that in 2015

¨3,477 people were killed and 391,000 injured¨ in crashes relating to texting while driving. This can even be illegal are result in murder.

Driving while on your phone can be illegal .If my other two arguments have not you proven that on the phone while driving then hopefully this argument will. Driving while holding your phone is illegal in my state of residence of Georgia. It is illegal under ¨the part of a sweeping hands-free law¨ according to www.usatoday.com `Even though driving with your phone may not be illgeal in your state as stated above it can possibly result in murder. ¨Texting while driving can lead to a homicide charge ¨says pittsburgcriminalattorney.com. The site says you get charged with this if you happen to cause the death of a person due to ¨recklessness¨ or ¨gross negligence¨.

Therefore due to your recklessness of not putting away your phone while behind wheels you can face heavy charges when it could have been prevented.

In conclusion driving with a phone present is a sure way to distract someone and possibly an accident. If that is not convincing then the accident can lead to the death of passengers or other drivers. This will result in heavy charges if deemed responsible for death. Therefore save everyone the trouble by simply putting your device away until you reach your destination or parking real quick. Concluding my argument why drivers should not be able to use a cellphone in any capacity is supported by not my words but professionals as well.

30A8FB981469,"PHONES AND DRIVING

In this world in which we live in, cell phones are a growing market as well as cars. The fact that we depend on cell phones throught the course of our day for numerous reasons.

Drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving because its easier to operate a phone in your hand than a cell phone that is not in your hand. Emergencies can occur while driving and you need to report the emergerncy while driving. Cell phones does not cause as big of a distracHon that other things that is done while driving.

A lot of people are in an uproar about driving and using a cell phone and someHmes it is overrated. Trying to operate a cell phone with one hand while maintaining driving has no danger to it. A phone that is mounted on the holder that begins to ring is harder to operate answering, dialing and switching calls.

Most Hmes the mounHng is not secure or has defected parts which can cause more of an issue than having it to your ear. Most people have older cars and cannot a? ord to upgrade and dont have the speaker opHon, which usually allows everyone surrounding your car to know you business.

I cannot say it enough, emergencies happen in a ?ash. Driving and you see a accident that needs emergency aLenHon you need to be able to use the cell phone to call it in. Things happen so quickly now and it could be your phone call that saves their life. Also if a person is lost and no gps signal but calls can be made a person should be able to dial someone by hand and get direcHons out of harms way. Emergency is a big deal in cell phone usage.

Cell phones do not cause as much as a distracHon than people make out to be. As a driver a person should always be aware of the road and be able to mulH-task when using a cell phone. Most Hmes its other things besides a cell phone that cause a distracHon but blames the cell phone as a scapegoat. There could be test on the driver liscence test that we should take to see if were able to drive and talk on the phone instead of just banning it.

Talking on a cell phone and driving a car may be a distracHon for some but not all. It should be our call on if we are focused enough to drive while talking. Although some people are said to have had bad behavior while talking and driving some are very responsible. TexHng and driving is di? erent from talking and driving and that should be the boundary. Each person should be accountable for their acHons just as speeding.   ",4,465,Phones and driving,Independent,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

E05C7F5C1156,"People are debating whether if drivers should or should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Some people think that using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should be allowed because they try multi-tasking and have important calls while some are addicted and can't stay off their phone. Other people says that you shouldn't be able to be on your cell phone while operating a vehicle because the cell phone can cause accidents while driving. I also think that you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle because it can cause vehicle collisions, slow reaction time, and fatal injuries. Therefore, driving can cause many accidents that can be fatal to the driver and passengers if there is any and cell phones should only be used when not operating a vehicle.

The first reason why the use of cell phones shouldn't be allowed while operating a vehicle because there are high chances of vehicle collisions happening. Most vehicle collisions happen when the driver is texting or under the influence of alcohol. When people who drives while texting spend more time looking at their phone than the road causing poor car-following ability and lateral lane control. While under the influence of alcohol it can cause you to lose concentration and it can also hinder your ability to make rational decisions.

As stated before, these are some examples of what can cause vehicle collisions.

The second reason why you shouldn't operate a cell phone while driving because of slow reaction time.

Reaction time is the measure of how quickly an organism can respond to a particular stimulus. When your spending time at your phone and finally look up to see you're about to get into an accident it would already be too late. Reaction times with no activity were between one and two seconds. Reaction times while using a cellphone were at least three to four seconds. On top of that, drivers were more likely to miss the flashing light altogether when using a cellphone. Cellphones effects the nervous system when a person is driving.

The last reason you shouldn't drive while using a cellphone because it can cause fatal injuries that might have long-term or short-term affects. The affects can be physical, emotional, or psychological. One of the most common physical effect is whiplash. Whiplash is caused by a sudden movement of the neck. Whiplash is usually caused by rear end automobile collisions. One emotional effect can be anxiety which can cause difficulties in certain situations involving driving. The last effect is psychological which can cause PTSD. Most car accidents are the results of PTSD but can also be caused by any traumatic experience. PTSD can affect a person's ability to function normally.

People who goes through this will sometimes show a wide range of symptoms including anger, fear, shock, nervousness and feeling of mistrust or guilt.

In conclusion, people shouldn't use cellphones while operating a vehicle. IF they do it can cause life changing accidents and other serious problems in life. Also, it can hurt some people financially causing them to pay for these uneventful occurrences. Some things people can do to prevent is to turn their phone off or put it on ""Do Not Disturb"" mode to prevent any accidents. They can also deal with that they have to do on the phone before starting the car and driving. One more solution is that they can have the passenger relay a message for you using your phone, so you won't be distracted or tempted to pick up the phone.

50B3435E475B,"Texting and driving

Over half of drivers in today's society have this horrible habit of texting and driving. This has to stop immediately, texting and driving puts people's lives at risk. This simple act has caused many fatalities over that last years. Fortunately, the government have put a new law to deal with this problem with our generations problem of texting and driving. I strongly feel that texting and driving is dangerous and should be prohibited.

Diving more into detail, texting and driving is hazardous and life threatening. Just imagine you're on the road driving to your friend's house and someone shoots you a text. You look down not even for 5 seconds; then you accidents swerve into the next lane hitting a car. There are so many different scenarios that could go wrong in that situation. Your life is over just because you couldn't wait to text your friend. The consequences that texting and driving comes with just isn't worth it.

The cost of a life shouldn't be worth a text message, Snapchat or Instagram DM (Direct Message). Texting and driving has taken many lives. In a recent article I read it said ""2017 U.S. Cell Phone and Driving Statistics. In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. About 421,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2017, 11% of drivers under age 20 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash."" This cannot go on any longer we must do something to stop these numbers from increasing.

Luckily the government has enforced a brand new law called ""Hands Free"".

This law states Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving. If you don't follow these laws they can fine you fifty to one hundred and fifty dollars. I feel that this action was necessary and justified to better protect our society.

Over all texting and driving is dangerous, has killed many people and is now on the decline thanks to the new "" Hands Down"" law.

Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones when driving because they can be severely injured or worse die. The number of crashes related to a phone and texting have made the use of a phone while driving illegal. Also the non use of a cell phone behind the wheel saves countless lives everyday.

Some states have also enacted laws to ban cell phone use. In the United States risk of automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than if they weren't on their phone.

Driving with a cell phone has been the main cause of vehicle crashes over the last decade. Which led to most states banning the use of the device completely. However One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving. Strong evidence that both retrieving and, in particular, sending text messages has a detrimental effect on that individual that increases their urge to use it.

2E0A63554A2C,"Should drivers be able to be on their phone while driving? My opinion to that question would be no for many reasons. You shouldn't have any distractions while driving. Way too many people are killed in car accidents and there doesn't need to be any other distractions while driving. Driving while using a cell phone is a vision distraction, it's law enforced, and it's a hazard to other drivers.

Any form of usage on a cell phone while being in the car is dangerous in many ways. Drivers need to sit back and think is texting or calling anyone at this very second worth a risk of taking or endangering not only my own life but risking it for any one else's.

Using a phone not only causes danger, but causes many forms of distraction and disorder. It can be physically danger in and kind of situation, it is mentally distracting depending on what the cause is, and can even become an issue not only with the protection of human but a problem with the law. Doing anything on the phone in that very moment is not worth taking anyone, yet their own life's but yet not worth getting into trouble that could've been avoided.

It's safer to have someone in the car with you, talking to you rather than you being on your phone. The passenger in the car can keep you company and keep you entertained. A cell phone will distract you and you could take your life and even someone else. Being on your phone could make you drive slower and cause other vehicles to pass you and that could cause an accident.

Drivers should not have in their possession at any time a cell phone. It's too much of a risk. There is no need for a snapchat or a game can't wait in order to not take you own life or someone else's. There is enough distractions while driving without it being a phone. A phone only makes it all worse.                     ",4,353,Phones and driving,Independent,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

EF6A87BE6D9F,"Everyone knows that texting and driving is a terrible idea, but only a few people seem to understand why. Using cellphones while driving is never a good mix for anyone. The generation now don't know the meaning of texting and driving. There are bad wrecks happening while driving and texting on the road. Drivers should never use their phone while driving. On your phone can really cause you to swerve off and on the road leading you to be in the other persons lane. Taking your eyes off the road has obvious disadvantages and it degrades our attention.

90% of car crashes is mostly the drivers fault, they mostly use the excuse of ""recognition error"". When you are in a divided conversation your attention is in different places like the road, a person in the car with you, or a phone call. All those distractions only one should mainly have your attention which i suggest be the road, and us as human we only have a little of attention to spare. Texting on a phone while driving can make you react more slowly to what your main focus should be on. We also feel immune to the risks of other people. Many of us have a lot of experience making bad decisions and suffering the consequences. It feels reasonable to infer that we are able to text and drive safely but some people may chose not to thinking they can do them all in any way.

DBF7EB6A9E02,"Operating a motor vehicle while on your cell phone

Being on your device and driving could be an overly dangerous choice in life. Many people around the world are injured by this situation every day. It could lead to accidents and altercations. In addition it would even cost you your licences. The most detrimental outcome is death. There are far more outcomes to operating a motor vehicle while being on a cell phone. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.

One leading cause to motor vehicle accidents is being on your cell phone. It could lead to accidents and altercations. Yourself and the passengers are more at risk to bodily injuries and harm. These bodily injuries and harm can range anywhere from mild to critical condition. In an motor vehicle accident there is more than one involved. There is another person or group of people that could have the exact same conditions than the driver on the cell phone. In an example of an altercations you could be more prone to damaging an building or such. An direct result of an event in place; a fee or very large payment would need to be made. Secondly another consequence could be having your license taken.

When you have violated a driving law there will always be an consequence. Rather it being jail time, injuries, or more. Your license will be subjected to suspension. A suspended license defines as you are not able to drive until they are reinstated. The process can take anywhere from a short period of time or even a long period of time. The average time for a suspended license is sixty days.

For some people if it is not your first offense they may even take your license for good. Furthermore there is another cause to driving while being on your cell phone.

After all the consequences the most detrimental is death. Many people happen to pass away due to a motor vehicle car accident. Not all people pass away at the crash site, some has a condition mild to critical that causes them to die. Around 1.6 million people a year die in motor vehicle accidents. Out of the 1.6 million, 1 out of 4 pass away because drivers are on their cell phone. That includes the driver and the unlucky few that may have been in the car, around, or in another car. Passing away from a motor vehicle accident can be prevented by simply waiting until you have reached a stopping point or your at your destination to pick up your phone.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. It can cause accidents and altercations, suspension of license, and even death. Prevention is simply not being able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle. Take a moment to focus on the road.

You are able to check your phone when you reach a red light or a complete stop. This is one step closer to its prevention. It will save many lives even your own.

I believe that drivers shouldn't use cell phones while driving because it is an attention hazzard. Driving with your phone in hand is not only illegal but very dangerous, but driving without the distraction of a phone can lower the driving fatality rates by a lot. Also, there are apps and programs on the phones that help drivers go hands free. Last, having that phone as a distraction while driving can cause a significant lowering of you reaction time and attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.

First and foremost, Driving without the phone as a distraction will generally lower the fatality rates of distracted driving accidents. Not only will it save you life and everyone else in the vehicle but also you will avoid needless deaths just because you couldn't put the phone down. The lack of self-control is the reason why people get distracted by their phones, especially the younger generation of drivers which leads to possibly fatal driving accidents.

Furthermore, Driving while distracted can significantly slow down your reactions to people, objects, and other cars on the road, with that you would be more likely to hit pot holes and debris on the road and a higher chance of causing an accident. Also, looking for pedestrians crossing while distracted just makes driving harder than it has to be.

Finally, There are various things that have been put in place to keep the driver from getting distracted by their phones, For example apps and programs on the phones that keep the driver from checking or responding to their phones. It prevents the driver from getting phone calls, texts, and other notifications while in the car. Another example, the hands-free laws that hold the people that like to drive with phone in hand accountable. Last is personal accountability, keeping yourself in check and safe but not just yourself but the people in the car with you and the other cars.

In conclusion, Drivers shouldn't drive while using a phone because if more people don't drive with their phones the likelihood of them getting into a possibly fatal accident decrease by a lot, there are also ways that you phone can keep itself from being a distraction like the apps and programs on it that block phone calls and texts, but more importantly the driver personally keeping themselves accountable for their actions on the road, and the fact that the more the driver is distracted the slower their reaction time is so they won't be able to pay closer attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.

CE98789F502B,"Although cell phones have been around for quite some time, they have become a key part of our lives. We use cell phones for anything now such as: texting, social media, calls, schedule planning, etc. Unfortunately, we are choosing to use them at the wrong time and wrong place, while we are driving. As time is going by, we are getting more and more into the phones that we don't care about our personal safety or others safety. Using cellphones while driving can be extremely dangerous to the drivers and others around them for many reasons.

When we are driving it can be exceedingly difficult to focus on the surroundings around us and easy to forget that you are sharing the road with other people and not just yourself. Other drivers take notice when drivers are on their phones whether they want to or not because of the danger they can cause. Erratic driving is something that we all get worked up about because it can make us late or can be inconvenient to us. Drivers also tailgate you because they can't keep the constant speed because they are on their phones. Sometimes pedestrians are killed because people are on their phones and don't pay attention to their surroundings. We may not intend to end someone's life, but we made the poor decision to drive and text so now we must live with that for the rest of our life.

Everyday people die in car accidents because we use cell phones while driving. According to my research the number one leading car accidents are distracted drivers. Research shows that being on your phone while driving can cause the risk 4x more of a horrible crash. Because we use cell phones more often now, we use our phones knowing the danger it could cause because we want to keep in touch with people. They also think that the hand-free is a safe thing to use because they are driving with two hands instead of holding the phone.

Driving with cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that they cause, it causes someone's insurance to rise, and it causes concerns to people's health. I think people are more concerned with their conversation than with their own safety and the safety of others. Research has proven that people who use cell phones while driving are more prone to be/cause an accident. People who use cell phones while driving does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. It also can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that could lead to tragedy.

In conclusion, people should stop texting and driving because it can cause serious damage. Not only that it can take someone's life. Texting while driving is a serious problem today because we are on our phones 24/7 and we don't usually put it down.

4FD61EB5AA60,"Have you ever seen an ambulance or two with a few cop cars rushing by and thought what's going on? Many people who are caught up in these types of situations do it to themselves by using their phones, causing accidents and injury that shouldn't have happened. This needs to stop, maybe even be helped if it can't be stopped.

Many people get upset when new rules coming out trying to limit phone use while driving. This shouldn't be the case though as they are just trying to prevent any unnecessary injury. This could also mean time in jail for the driver for being on his or her phone in the first place. This again causes unnecessary problems that could be avoided. The person who was using their phone would also have to pay a fee for the damages to the vehicle or even the person.

Another reason people shouldn't be able to use cell phones all the time is because there's always a time where and ambulance is driving by or even a cop. Most people would pull to the side. On the other hand, if your blasting and unaware of your surrounding because your using your phone you wouldn't be able to hear them unless they were right next to you. This could cause injury to whoever they were rushing to get to. If it was a cop It would be bad for the driver blasting music too. Not being able to use the phone keeps you safer and out of trouble.

A way to make it somewhat safe for phone use however is to have a Bluetooth connection in the car. This is a pretty good compromise. People can just use their car to control phone needs. All calls can be answered and texts can be read without looking at a phone. This will keep the person safe and make looking at the phone less of a problem. This however wouldn't stop all problems which is why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in capacity while driving.

In conclusion driving around in general isn't the safest thing ever. Adding an extra distraction that makes driving even more dangerous isn't smart. People shouldn't be mad at laws made because people make bad decisions while driving. Laws are made to keep us safe so if a law to not let people use phones it would help stop accident and other unnecessary injuries or problems.

Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. Cell phones are now starting to be a part of life using everyday technology to do a lot of stuff. Paring this and driving is not a good combination, why you shouldn't do it and how it effects people.

Drivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. For example, It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst-case could kill them self or other people.

Reports have that 1.6 million crashes are caused because of texting and driving. There are a lot of other reasons why not to do it to. First of you must set an example towards the passengers that are in your car rather it be your kids or you friends. Secondly its illegal in a lot of places but Texas is one of the only seven states that have yet to completely ban texting and driving. Lastly and the one that gets told a lot is that your eyes are taken off the road, A person is 23 times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while sending a text message, than if they were only driving. That number towers over the other activities associated with distracted driving.

In conclusion you should never texting and driving it is the most leading cause of death within motor vehicle crashes.

DAF93C36D655,"Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accidents occur and most of the time this lead to a vehicular accident that can result in death. The biggest age group affected by this problem would have to be teens aging from 16 up to adults aging around 30. In the end, no one benefits from this problem other than the law enforcement team who has worked so hard to stress the importance of no texting while driving and funeral homes that are being paid for burial expenses. The reason I say that the law enforcement benefit from the problem would have to be because this is an example of exactly what it is that they try so hard to avoid. Funeral homes benefit because most of these cases end in a tragic accident that allow the funeral home to prepare a home going ceremony. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it gives people a chance to see what can happen if a person continue to text and drive. People really need to understand how easily it is take the life of someone else or even themselves. And most of the time in many cases relating to this particular problem, it is always is the age groups ranging from 16 years of age to 30 years of age.

A97DE0D49AEA,"Should Drivers Be Allowed To Use Cell Phones When Driving?

Why Driver's should desist from using their Cell Phones while DrivingHundreds of research indicate that using the cell phone while driving is a dangerous prospect that leads to loss of lives. Statistically, 50 minutes of phone chatter while driving increases the likelihood of a car crash or car accident almost five-fold (Crundall, 2017). Texting has also emerged as an issue but many reported cases indicate talking on the cell phone while driving. In the United States, 20 states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones, while another 48 states have banned text messaging while driving (National Conference of State Legislature [NCSL], 2019). Surprisingly, no state is yet to pass laws banning cell phone use across a multitude of drivers, and this explains the continued rise in cell phone-use induced car and road accidents. The majority of drivers and motorists claims that 'being distracted by mobile phones"" is the leading cause of car and road accidents.

One major issue concerns the risk of using one hand to navigate bends and respond to potential hazards while talking on the phone. According to Crundall (2017), the majority of roads accidents in Europe occur in steep slopes, bends and corners, with 35% of them involving the driver communicating on his/her cell phone. Another issue involves the act of conversation which leads to a loss of concentration - cognitive processing - that ultimately leads to an accident (NCSL, 2019). Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University conducted a simulation study and discovered that the human spatial brain activity is affected when performing dual-task, leading to loss of concertation and hence accidents (Crundall, 2017). Processing of auditory messages becomes a problem when driving and communicating on a cell phone, explaining why a driver, under no circumstances, is required to use his/her cell phone while driving.

Throughout the years people have lost their lives due to the use of their cellular phones. Using phones while driving could be dangerous for everyone that's on the road 24/7. Innocent people that go to work a drive every day put their lives at risk for other people that drive while using their phones. Phones should not be used while driving.

People that use their phones while driving put their lives at risk for the simple fact that they could cause an accident on the highway or even in the streets. People choose the wrong moment while driving to look at their phones and sometimes forget that they share the road with other innocent people and they turn what could simply be a normal day to a tragic ending on a person's life. Phones haven't been out for that long and we as humans can get so distracted by just looking down at your phone and not being aware of the cars around you or in front of you. Every year more people die for causing an accident while using their phone or is killed by a person thats on their phone when not supposed to.

In the U.S., 4637 people died in car crashes in 2018 due to cell phone use. Including the cost of people's lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion dollars. The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 millions crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving , these mortality death rates are from every country that people are able to have a phone. One out of four cars accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. however , the sad reality is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to fatal car accidents. On average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to people that are distracted by their phones while driving.

Ways that we can prevent accidents of people using their phones while driving is that people should put their phone on silent or out of reach. People should be able to use their phone if they are going to a certain location and they need to use their GPS. car accidents are mostly caused by the fact that nowadays teenagers have the privilege of driving around with innocent people that go to work to bring food to the table. Most teenagers know the risks that their lives could be at risk while driving. According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyways. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accident were distracted by their cell phones.

In case drivers on cell phones have more mischances, at that point drivers ought to be precluded from utilizing them. Drivers on cell phones do have more mishaps. Hence, drivers ought to be disallowed from utilizing cell phones. To create this contention, you must clarify and protect both of its premises, and they require very diverse contentions.

Should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I believe that drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle. According to the article ""Cellphone Use While Driving Statistics and Texting and Driving Facts"" states that according to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. ""Talking or texting while driving or checking social media posts takes eyes off the brain off the task of driving"":

states a message that phones has become a distraction to the human brain, but not only distracting the human brain, but is also becoming a habit to human beings.

Distraction has become a huge part in car crashes and people's injuries. Cellphones has become an important component to many human routines. Therefore, it doesn't come to a surprise or a shocked moment that gadgets such as cellphones, tablets, or any other technology devices are ambiguous. Phones not only put the driver in danger, but also other people such as passengers and the other driver in danger.

So for that exact reason, many states implemented the law to not text while driving or you will get a big, fine ticket just for the safe of other people .

AC594194F01C,"I am typing about why drivers should not use phones while driving. This is my opinion and I will be backing it up. It is also a law all over the world. Not texting or being on your phone can save lives if you are driving.

I say don't think it is smart to be on your phone while driving because it can cause accidents. There are 1.6 million car crashes a year because people are driving with their phones out. If more people put down their phones then they can know what's going on around them to slow the death rate down. There are 10 percent of teens that die in car crashes because they are on their phones. they are distracted by the internet or people texting them more then there life.

If you need a phone for a gps because you don't know where to go then you can use the audio. It will be safer that way because you wont need to keep looking down at your phone or have the passenger help you if you are driving with someone else. Your life means more then a text that can end it all for you or someone else.    ",2,204,Phones and driving,Independent,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

45A33DB5C7F7,"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. A cell phone put drivers at a greater risk of a wreck. People still use cell phones because they want to be available and keep in touch with other people. They think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. They use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

People whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. They can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to an injury.. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. Hands Free don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. It show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. People have proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man work, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

People say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.

4F0E197053FF,"Drivers Should Be Limited As To When They Can Use Their Phones While Driving

Drivers who are distracted by their phone while driving have an increased risk of crashing. Crashes affect both the crasher and any possible crashing victims. Everything from physical pain to emotional pain as well as financial pain can be felt after a crash. 3,287 deaths happen every day due to fatal car crashes. On average, 9 of these fatalities are related to distracted driving. Due to the inability to test if a crash was due to distracted driving, it is believed that the recorded number of distracted driving incidents is greatly under-recorded.

Over 80% of drivers admit to not paying attention to the road while they are doing blatantly hazardous behaviors while driving. The listed activities are not always the driver interacting with their phone, however it is safe to assume that interacting with their phone is one of the many hazardous activities these drivers admitted to doing. Distracted driving is now considered to be the ""new drunk driving"" since it follows the same psychological pattern. With recent studies of phone addiction showing some of the same signs as drug addiction, people are having a harder time ignoring their phone. It is no coincidence that car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.s and that 16-19 year olds have a three times higher chance to be involved in a fatal crash than any other age group while studies show that teens and younger children are the most addicted to their phones.

While it is dangerous to be interacting with your phone while driving some people have no choice in the matter. Reasons for this can range from work related texts or phone calls to family matters. Some states are trying what is called a ""hands free law"" that makes it illegal for a driver to hold their phone while they are driving. It also states that a driver cannot read or watch videos on their phone while driving. Because of this law there have been multiple accessories made that allow drivers to mount their phones in their car so that they can send voice messages or speech to text messages. The law along with the accessories allow these types of drivers to access their phones, though very limited, and keep up to date with their important concerns.

The hands free law and the accessories could make the open roads a little safer for everybody while allowing people to keep their phones in their car but it is important to remember that no matter how many laws are put into place, people will still continue to abuse them and accadences will still happen. It comes down to the individual and how properly educated they are and whether or not they can mentaly handle a responsibility like driving.

Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with the their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the electronic device. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about it also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. Another reason to ban the ususage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising.

019328A0D7A3,"Phones and Driving

Look around you! All you see is people from all ages staring at a device all day which is a phone. People are always stuck on their phones, that it seems they can never let it go while:working ,at school,cleaning,and driving. Some things caused by using your phone while driving are car accidents, irresponsible people driving, or you can get a fee.

Phones can be such a distraction to everyone at anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard. A major cause of deaths in the US is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time. ""About 33,700 people die in motor vehicle each year"" shown on CDC. This means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors, but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future. In the article ""Mobile phones and driving safety"", it stated that,""In a 2011 study it was reported that over 90% of college students surveyed texts (initiate,reply,or read) while driving."" It proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have. If people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phones.

Many people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle. In reality, everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving. According to an article of "" Teen driver source"", ""In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving.""The other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them. In another passage on ""Science Daily' stated that, adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text, reading texts, on social media, or their just distracted driving. I believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the car.

Both the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones, but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedy.

Each state in the US has their own laws to protect their people. Since some don't listen the people in charge of the state they've made laws for people who drive careless. About 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones (Facts & Statistics about texting and driving). Even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones, almost all of them have which is a good difference. In some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving, you can get a fee depending where you live. For example, Georgia has a fee of $150, Florida has one of $30,and New Jersey has one of $400. The fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didn't learn the first time from the fee. If the US keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn.

In conclusion, driving while using your phone at any age isn't right. By one simple distraction something tragic could occur. It's not always teens driving reckless, but if anyone act young by not responsibly driving then they could get a fee they have to pay. Driving while using the phone should be taken more serious to prevent any issues.

4B6C254FEE39,"Imagine waking up to a call in the middle of the night saying you lost your loved one in a car accident because they decided a text was more important than their life? Texting while driving increases the risk of an accident 23.2 times compared to unimpaired driving which is a sobering statistic provided by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in 2018. Using the phone while driving has spread throughout the nation, and with people being so impatient in today's society, texting and driving has had damaging effects on people and their families. Phones have become a key part of our lives but it's our job as people to know when and where to use our phones especially as drivers. Driving while distracted by the phone can affect everyone involved physically, mentally, as well as financially.

Driving and texting is something very common, but a serious problem with detrimental effects. The main detrimental effect could be physical. When a person texts and drives, a person could cause an accident, which could not only endanger themselves, but it could endanger others.

According to the National Safety Council, ""Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year."" These are deaths added to this already hectic world that could have been easily avoided.

Not only can texting while driving affect a person physically but it can also affect a person mentally.

While physical damage to a vehicle or physical injury to a person can often be resolved in a matter of days or weeks, emotional damage may last a lifetime. Author and blogger Rebecca Goldfarb recently categorized the types of emotional damage as shock, anger, guilt, anxiety and depression and even post-traumatic stress. Goldfarb added many people who are involved in an accident as either the driver or as the victim often need to receive professional care if the difficult emotions are lasting longer than expected.

The final way in which driving while distracted may negatively affect a person is financially. According to the website big AZ BIG Media, there are six types of costs that may happen following a car accident. The first two immediate financial costs involve the repair of personal property and the costs with healthcare and medical treatment. The second two financial costs involve possible legal fees and an increase to car insurance. Finally, the last two costs involve the loss of employment (income and benefits) and the possible cost of a career change if the person cannot return to their job.

In conclusion, texting while driving is not a wise decision. Texting while driving can negatively affect everyone involved physically, mentally and even financially. Oprah Winfrey summarized this point on April 26, 2010 on her website with these words ""But this is a real problem we can do something about and get immediate results. All we have to do is hang up or switch off. It really is that simple. Once we do that, not another son or daughter will have to die because someone was on the phone and behind the wheel-and just not paying attention."" The solution is simple, don't text and drive.               ",4,529,Phones and driving,Independent,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

F054050F442F,"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to.

D07F55A0F5DB,"Phones and Driving

Phones play a big role in the generation we now live in. We may not realize how phones or electronics in general are affecting society and what we do on a daily basis. These phones are affecting human life slowly from all ages including babies. One of the main impact that cell phones have had on society is the use of them while driving a vehicle and this shouldn't be allowed.

In many cases using a cell phone while driving has had a big impact on society and should be banned in all States. People should not be allowed to use their phones while driving For instance people texting or talking on the phone (physically holding phone)while driving is a big distraction. These people are the causes of accidents and usually innocent people die because of dull decisions people take.

As a result the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has stated that in 2016, 3,450 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and the numbers have increased over the years. Also according to them when people take their eyes off for five seconds while going fifty-five mile per hour, it is long enough to cover a football field (""Distracted Driving"") . There are billions of reasons why people go against it and why we should have them banned while driving and this is for our safety.

Everyone on the road is at risk. We can all help out by taking action to prevent innocent people's life. For example by simply just putting away the cell phone, you can prevent so many things and reduce the chances of crashing and you'll be more focused on the road. We can also text or call anyone before starting the car and then put on Do Not Disturb that iphones provide, which does not allow calls or texts from anyone. There are so many options to prevent you touching your phone while driving. We just all have to take action and make the road a safer place .

4C30EEDA3A8F,"There shouldn't be a discussion when it comes to texting and driving for obvious reasons. It's just as dangerous as driving under the influence. And there are plenty of ways to send a message using hands free technology. It also being illegal should really mean that you shouldn't be doing it. And you can also kill someone just to send a text message. But it is common in the United States.

Texting and driving has been banned in most of the United States there are only 2 states that haven't banned texting and driving. And of you get caught by a cop you will be fined up to $400. And that is a lot of money for just sending a text. And may also cause your license to get suspended. It makes sense because when you text and drive you are twenty three percent more likely to get into a car crash. That makes just as dangerous as driving under the influence.

A lot of people don't actually know how dangerous and common texting and driving really is. It makes up eighteen percent of fatal car crashes. And more than 35 percent of teens and adults admit to texting and driving. So even though people know what could happen they still do it either way. And more then ninety percent of people know how dangerous texting and driving is. People take there eyes off the road for four seconds on average which is long enough for you to swerve on to another lane. And at least 9 people are killed every day by distracted drivers.

There are plenty of easy ways to prevent texting and driving. One way is to have your phone out of reach and on silent so if you get a message or a call you won't be able to get tempted to reach for your phone. Another way is to use an app to block incoming texts or calls. Some apps can send an auto response back, letting the sender know that you are driving and will respond when you are not driving. And one way is to be committed to not texting and driving.

In conclusion texting and driving and driving distracted is a big problem that can easily be avoided. But people still tend to do it anyways. People should pay a fine if caught by a police officer. And should get there license suspended if they do it a lot. People should be more aware about the consciences that can be caused by this petty action. To keep it simple would you drive 1 ton of pure machinery at 60 miles per hour blindfolded.

20FD63F49519,"Not Using Phones while Driving

Throughout the years, teenagers have been eager to turn 16. Driving is a nerve wrecking and exciting experience at the same time. There is a good upside about driving and that would be being able to go out to places without having to pay and the time period you can stay out for is how long you desire. Even though there is a good side, there is a bad side as well. This would have to be the large amount of people that are not cautious around their surroundings and many lives have been taken away due to this. I would have to agree with the idea that says that phones should not be used while driving , my reasons for this are that peoples lives are taken away, a phone is a big distraction, and it is a law you have to follow.

My first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because too many lives are taken everyday. Utilizing a phone while driving takes many lives every second of our daily lives. About 1.6 million lives a year end up in critical conditions or worse, dead. A phone call or text can wait, but being impatient can result in deaths. This impatiences creates danger to the person driving and everyone around them. Too many lives are taken by near accidents, crashes, distractions, and running of lights caused by usage of phones by operating moving vehicles. Many more lives could be safer if people chose to wait for their usage of phones after being off the road.

My second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because, too many distractions are already on the road without adding a phone as another reason. Once again, using a phone while driving creates too many distractions for the driver and everyone around is left in danger. For example, phones can create delays on stop lights which can create simple accidents. The glare of a bright phone on a dark night can actually interfere with the sight of the driver and can cause loss of control or misguidance to swerving. As well as sudden loud sounds from a phone can actually scare or frighten a driver straight to a crash. Occuping phones while driving is one of the biggest reasons for caused crashes all over.

My third and final reason for not using phones while driving is because, a new law recently has been released on how using phones on the road is no longer permitted anymore. The new law was put in to ensure more safety due to all the distractions caused by phones. Since it is a new law, a new law means that it is expected to be followed, a new set out rule. It is for the safety of people and everyone surrounding. People will get punished if the new law is not followed and in my opinion, i would say that it is one of the greatest laws forced. The new law will minimize the amount of crashes caused by phones on the road all over and save many more lives and everyone around.

A phone should not ever be used while a person is driving for any type of situation, it can wait. My reasons, once again like i said before is that many lives are taken away, it is also a big distraction, and last would be that it is a new law. A phone is really entertaining and that is something people do not want behind the wheel because then it can become a distraction.

Through the whole essay all I could come to head would be about the peoples lives taken away left with a broken down family. Phones ultimately should not be used while driving and a person should not have to double think it, before they cause a new tragedy that will leave them with a lifetime of consequences and guilt.

7C66D3531735,"Should drivers be allowed to use cellphones while driving?

Drivers should not be allowed to text while drive is what I believe statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teens. 12 million car crashes in 2013 involved crashes in text messages. Texting while driving show that this multitasking at least 341,000 behind the wheel is becoming more dangerous and life threatening now. Because technology will change and new distractions will be involved. According to research conducted at children's hospital teens who don't frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away there the phones while driving outweigh any drawbacks such as being able to pay attention better on the road, and being less likely to have crash and also following the law. Parents should also avoid talking to students as that can also be a big distraction for them. Cellphones aren't just about texting but multi behaviors it's about anything that can cause a distraction from the road such as social media apps , and music have the potential to draw away from the road. Cellphone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent. Texting is undeniably the most dangerous thing a person can do while on the road and its becoming more and more common as the leading causes of death from car crashes are just that and intoxication. Today the majority of humans own and operate cellphones on a daily basis and that's a distraction from what they're doing and can be very dangerous when your driving because you aren't paying any attention to the road and can kill someone.

Something as simple as calling someone can also be dangerous but it's not the leading cause of death. from driver's messages and keeping your eyes on the road is and that's really a major dilemma for someone else who's unaware of that. so I believe that in the future people should always make to keep an open eye for this because it can be very life threatening.

I would consider this age the phone boom since widely now everyone has or owns a communication device and this allows for simple talking and texting time now moves a lot faster than before so people are now trying to catch up with it and that can really become distraction for a lot of people. And those really aren't safe anymore because that can cause car crashes and even death that put you and someone else at a high risk paying attention and being aware is very important you don't want be the cause of someone's death or maybe even a child's death because you were to ignorant to follow the basic law so my plan would be to limit the use of phones on the road while driving and allowing only when you are parked.

The general driving statistics on the national safety reports that that texting while driving made a dramatic increase of 1.6 million crashes an estimated year high. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

The statistics?

While driving and texting may seem not that much to worry about the death toll seems to speak much for itself. 1 out of 4 accidents and car crashes happen because texting and phone use during driving this seems to be all too common for teens in some areas because according to the AA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting which also means there aware of the safety concerns these situations tend to have people nationwide. Teens are more susceptible to car crashes the likely hood of adults they are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near crashes than adults are prone too. A teen driver who has a passenger in the car doubles the risk more than 5x likely. A cellphone use becomes a national problem there never a reason to risk your life and someone else's to get a simple text in the chances of getting into a car crash with a passenger increase don't be careless is the importance of this drive safe.

79E5179D5BB6,"Texting and Driving

Driving will always need your undivided attention at all times. There are many obvious reasons you shouldn't text and drive. You can get in a wreck, hit a pedestrian, and it puts your life at risk. Driving is a privilege and you should always follow the rules of the road. Using your mobile device can put you and the people around you in danger.

First of all, Texting and driving can get you in a terrible car wreck. When your on your phone your reaction time is bad. You can miss a stop sign and another car can come from the left or right side of you and you wouldn't see it coming. This can also raise your insurance rate up or you can be sued depending on how bad the accident is. Why risk it when you can wait or pull over to send that text? When you're looking down might not see pedestrians cross the street.

Besides getting into a car wreck you can also injure another person for being careless. Driving in a neighborhood needs your full attention. If you use your mobile device in a neighborhood you can either hit a pet, a jogger, or even a child if you're not paying attention. If such thing happens you can either get sued or go to jail for manslaughter. This is another major reason why you shouldn't be using your phone on the road.

Most importantly, getting distracted by your cell phone can put your life and other people's lives at risk. The most common deaths road deaths are caused by someone who were on their phones. You crashing can also cause a domino effect with other cars hitting each other on an intersection or a highway. That one text is not worth putting your life and other people's lives at risk. You don't want to end up in the hospital or even worse end up dead.

In conclusion, you should never use your phone while driving under no circumstances. If you need to make an emergency call, you should invest in a bluetooth hands free radio to make your phone calls. It is your duty to make the road you drive in safe for yourself and others. Make sure your eyes are always on the road no matter what.

In today's current society almost everyone in the world has access or owns a cellular device. That device that can call text or email right from your pocket. While it is so very useful it can also become quite distracting to someone who might be driving. Which leads to the point that Drivers should not be able to access their phones while driving. In these cases its smart to look at the annual driver and cell phone related instances that have happened over the years as well as the averages of crashes involving phones and the driver.

Cell Phone users while they are driving are 5.36 times more likely to get into an accident when driving accordion to a study done at the University of Utah (""Drivers on Cell Phones Are as Bad as Drunks."" University of Utah News, archive. unews. utah. edu/news_releases/drivers-on-cell-phones-are-as-bad-as-drunks/). These statistics show how more likely a driver is to get in an accident while on their cell phones. That isn't a small number 5.36 is a larger number of people when taking into account how many use their phones while driving anyways. This leads into how many people actually die to chances like these.

In 2015 alone there were 3,477 people killed in a distracted driver accident. 476 of which in those cases were cell phone users.(""Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving."" EndDD, www. enddd. org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoaz3BRDnARIsAF1RfLevzm7d8WG_o9fmbSLCDrfzuhq4pSz6LYGnFCL65o0N-OBsj-T8u8YaAh1_EALw_wcB.). These numbers when taking into account how those deaths could have been prevented by simply putting the phone down while driving are extremely high. That is 13 percent of all drivers that died last year were on their phones. And those people would still be alive had they put the phone down.

These statistics do not lie when saying how people die due to cellular phones being used while driving.

21730F71662E,"Phones and Driving

In this day in age of technological advancement, mankind has quickly adapted to using devices such as cellphones. It has gotten to the point where we constantly use it for everything we do. There seems to be many good qualities about the cellphone which humans seem to keep all are attention on. That in turn causes problems with our surroundings such as being on the phone and driving a vehicle.

There is no denying that cellphones take up all of our attention. There are just so many things that we are able to do that makers have put in it. It is just to ensure that we never get bored while also waiting for the next phone with technological superiority to be released. Likewise, with driving. It takes up all of our focus to make sure we don't get into a car wreck. In a way, driving and being on a cellphone are very similar in regards to how much attention we give it. So when putting both together, the ending result are what you would expect it to be, catastrophic.

Cellphones and driving take up a lot of focus and because of that, we constantly are switching from looking at our phones to paying attention to the road and oncoming traffic ahead (assuming there is any that is). They do not balance out well and people can easily get into car accidents as a result. This most notably happens when a person is trying to text and drive at the same time. It was this very reason why texting and driving has been made illegal to ensure the safety of fellow drivers. You would think the problems lay with teenagers doing it, but adults have a higher statistic level when it comes to this, providing more fatality rates to go up. Add that in with alcohol and there is no telling what will happen.

In the end, we just should not use our phones while we drive. It quickly turns into a habit once we start and it will not end well. It can also result in being arrested if caught by a local police officer. We should get everything out of the way before we start driving or stop and park somewhere before we engage into the activities on our phone. There are plenty of safe ways to use a phone while inside of a vehicle, we just choose the most dangerous route.

09CB9D5CDDDD,"Young adults and teens can not put their phone down for a second. Any notification they receive is so important to them. The first thing they do is check and see what popped up on their phone. The worst time for this to happen is when they're driving because they will still cheak no matter what they're doing. Using your phone while driving can cause you to get a ticket, cause you to hurt someone, and even cause you to hurt yourself.

People may think nothing of driving and being on their phone. Police always advertise to let others know not to use their phones while driving but they refuse to listen. Now if a police officer catch anyone on their phone while driving they will get a ticket. Everyone hates when authority stops them. It's the worst feeling ever and to make it worst is for the reason to be just being on your phone.

If people are driving and on their phone they're not focused on what's in front of them. Anything can pop up in front of the vehicle at any time. Things like animals, people, and even cyclist can appear in front once you up from your phone. The only problem is the driver may not look up in time and hit someone or something. There is a possibility that whoever the driver hit could suffer major injuries or even death.

Not only are you putting others in danger, you're also putting yourself in danger. Like mentioned before, anything can pop up in front of you vehicle. This time around it can be another car, truck, or even a bus. Crashing into one these just from being on a phone can possibility cause instant death. Maybe you might have quick reflexes and try to avoid collision. There is a possibility still hit something else like a tree. Some may be lucky enough to only be injured or not harmed at all.

In the end, using your phone while driving can result in you getting in serious trouble or causing harm to yourself and others. Authority can stop you if they notice it. Other citizens can harmed by you for not paying attention. Also you can harm yourself. Just do not do it because it's not worth it. It can wait.

A783D3241786,"Have you ever been behind someone that has been on there phone and didn't know the light was green or when someone almost hit you because they didn't see you because they were looking at their phone?

To start things off, I believe that there is a time and place for being on your phone with behind the wheel. If you are at a red light and you don't have to type or just have to answer a call or change a song i believe that is an acceptation to the rule of being on your phone. Since we are in the time and age were we have Bluetooth in cars and can connect to our phones so it makes it easier to call and or answer calls. Texting and driving is a must stop because you may think that you will be fine and can multitask but in reality you are putting you and the other drivers in danger. No one's parents should have to attend their child's funeral because they died from texting and driving or because someone else was texting and driving. There are many reasons not to use a phone while driving but there are also exceptions to this rule now you may not agree with me on this but this to me is the best actions to do because people will not stop with getting on their phones while driving but at least we could limit it to just a few ways that they could get on it while being behind the wheel.

Secondly, with technology still evolving in this day like now they are getting driverless cars that may be the next big step in the world of vehicles. Now with these cars we don't need to worry about the needs of driving cars if there is no steering wheel.

Every day about 11 teens die due to texting and driving in the United States but with today's technology they are trying to help stop texting and driving but everything we do doesn't seem to be helping and or stopping teens from texting behind the wheel. Some people still might not agree with me on what I believe is important but if you just give it some years maybe just maybe it may be possible in today's society that no one can get hurt from texting and driving.

Lastly, although it's a big problem for people to stop texting and driving, it's not a ban in every state in the United States. It's said that only 39 states put a ban for novice drivers because it isn't the biggest deal for some people to be able to text and drive which I know doesn't sound great but it's kind of the truth in a way. I personally have no experience of this because I can't drive but i see people who do drive and do this and it's not like it's every time it mainly at red lights you see them doing it. Now out the 39 states 20 of them ban it for school bus drivers also.

It's taken the USA almost 14 years and people still don't listen to no texting and driving.

To conclude, have you ever been behind some or seen someone texting and driving? I got to tell you some facts that maybe you didn't know about texting and driving and even I learned something new. I also gave some changes that could happen in the near future that could change how we see texting and driving.

173969D5E8D1,"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become mandatory in most of our lives. Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones Were founded in 1992. Since smartphones were created every year they get more modern. For example june 7, 2010 facetime was created. The smartphone is changing the human race in surprising ways.

Driving and using your cell phone at the same time is very dangerous. Most people think that they can drive so being on their phone while driving wont hurt anybody or anything, but anybody who agrees with this is wrong and is in danger every time he/ she pulls out a phone while the car is in drive. Also, if you use your cellular device and drive at the same time you always have someone else's life at stake. Even if you're in the car by yourself you can hurt someone else, imagine you have your head down in your phone while driving and you look up and you about to hit a car and swerve to the right and hit a whole family walking on the sidewalk. Then your in a bad situation just because you couldn't wait till you get home to text or look at your instagram feed. One little bad time to look at your phone and your hurting a family.

I believe that you shouldn't be allowed to use your phone while your car is in drive. In georgia they made a new law that you can't have your phone in your hand while on the road,not even to tap play and if you get caught the law enforcement will pull you over and give you a $50 fine. I believe it should be like this in every state , it the makes the community a lot safer. Did you know 11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. As of January 2019, three states -- Arizona, Montana, and Missouri -- insanely do not have laws against texting while driving.

According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers knows the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. 21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. The 2017 study published by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety Found that 87% of drivers view texting and driving as the most significant hazard on the road. In fact, drivers are more concerned about texting / distracted driving than they are about drunk driving. A single text can end many lives.

In conclusion, using your cellular device while driving is dangerous on all cases. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving. A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. I Think you can wait to answer that text.

As we drove to the final basketball game of the season against our rivals Milton High School, I was having a great time with my best friend. Paige and I were stopped at the intersection on Highway 9 when a white SUV crashed into the back of her Nissan Rogue. We were both rushed to the hospital where my friend learned that her leg was broken in two places. Paige could not finish the rest of her swim season and was absolutely devastated. We later found out that the driver behind us was looking down at her cell phone and didn't notice that the light had turned red. The driver's one second of distracted driving affected my best friend's life for months although, thankfully, her use of a cell phone did not end it. As a result of the risk to the public, drivers should not be allowed to use handheld cell phones while operating a vehicle.

Operating a vehicle requires attention and focus. Anything that interrupts a driver's concentration leads to a dangerous distraction. Three main types of distracted driving are visual, manual, and cognitive. Drivers who text and drive, snap and drive, instagram and drive, or simply call home while driving are endangering the public. Texting while driving is particularly harmful because it combines all three types of distracted driving . According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers who send or read a text while driving lose concentration and take their eyes off the road for up to five seconds. Those five seconds of using a handheld cell phone are a great risk to the public.

Statistics show that using a handheld phone while operating a moving vehicle risks the welfare of the public. In ""Cell Phone Use and Driving,"" Louis Hugo Francescutti states that using a cell phone while driving increases the risk of collisions four to six times, and drivers are twice as often to be in a rear-end collision. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nine people are killed each day, and the public is involved in more than one-thousand car crashes due to distracted driving. Francescutti writes that researchers believe that distracted driving causes twenty-five to ninety percent of car collisions. Clearly, these statistics demonstrate the danger of distracted driving.

Although distracted driving causes over four thousand deaths each year, there are solutions to this tragedy. One obvious solution is not using the phone at all while driving; however, other possible solutions include the use of bluetooth and phone mounts to decrease the number of deaths. Since driving requires attention and focus, making the choice not to use the phone while driving limits the risk to the driver and to the public. When absolutely necessary, the use of bluetooth and phone mounts can offer drivers phone access while still protecting the public. These two alternatives should only be used in case of an emergency.

Clearly, operating a vehicle while using a handheld cell phone is dangerous. Georgia recognized these dangers and passed legislation to prevent the use of handheld devices when driving; however, some drivers fail to follow the law. The driver who caused my accident received a citation for using her device while driving. Hopefully, the next time she goes out on the road she will think about the danger to others and act responsibly.

Sometimes you have to ask yourself is it really that important?

Cell phones have become a key factor in many lives today. People tend to use cell phones for just about any and everything. As a people, we tend to rely on our phones at any given moment. Since the invention of telephones, society has been using phones for texting, talking, social media, etc. For those uses, cell phones have put us at risk. We tend to use or cell phones when we are walking across the street, and most importantly when we are driving. Operating a car while texting/talking results in the driver becoming a hazard to other drivers on the road.

Firstly, there is no doubt that we are addicted to our phones. Our phones have led us to be distracted. A distraction is something that prevents someone from giving their full attention to something else. For instance, when we are driving, we hear our phones ring and instantly we pick it up to answer. It is the inner use telling us that we are amazing drivers, and that one little call will not distract us from the road. In all reality, one little phone call does distract us from when the light changes, or when someone needs to get over to the other lane. Cell phones reduce driving performance.

As well as that, drivers have to operate both the phone and the car, which leads to car accidents. Using the cell phone and driving the car at the same time, reduces the drivers ability to concentrate on the road. All it takes is two seconds to look down at the phone, and the next thing you know, you have caused a life or yours. Car accidents are well known in the community to be caused by texting and driving. Not to mention, being on the phone and driving-slows down reactions to traffic lights and other traffic events, which also causes car accidents. Equally important, during bad weather on slippery road, engaging in conversation equals to paying less attention to the road increasing fatal accidents.

Although, there are negative impacts of texting and driving, it could also be beneficial. The beneficial parts could consists of using it for emergency purposes. For example, calling for assistance on the side of the road, reporting an incident while driving, or simply calling for help. In addition, cell phones can be used for navigation to an unknown destination. Cell phones always provide you with information about news, weather, and alerts for any city you are driving in.

In conclusion,it can be concluded that texting is not only an effective way of communication, but always a safety concern. Different studies have shown that many accidents are caused by phones and driving daily. Phones and driving is a dangerous habit people have picked up on. How many people are going to have to get hurt before realize their actions have consequences? We have to understand that phones and driving is extremely dangerous, and has to be stopped.

Most humans have that habit of attending to their phone when they receive a notification while driving. They are so anxious to know what's going on right there at that moment. But they have no idea of how much danger they are putting themselves & others in! Using a phone while driving can wait. Here's why!

First, you can't multitask & pay attention to both a phone & the road at the same time. If you can't pay attention to the road, you're not aware of what is coming at you, your surroundings, potholes on the road & pedestrians! Driving is not only about you valuing your safety but also others & avoiding mishaps.

Second, you could enter other lanes just by slanting the steering wheel a little without knowing it! So therefore, you're putting others at risk because you're not concentrating on the positioning of your vehicle which could lead to crashing into something whether it is another vehicle, pedestrian or object. You could also damage your car by hitting curbs or potholes in the street which could also result in a flat tire or the car needing a new wheel alignment, something like that.

Lastly, it is proven that using a phone while operating a vehicle is a high risk. Cellular devices are involved in approximately 1.6 million auto accidents causing nearly 500,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. Using a device & driving maybe more dangerous than driving under the influence. Just think about it.

Those are my reasonings for advocating that phones shouldn't be used while operating a vehicle. It's a high risk & dangerous. But hey, it's just my opinion!

Phones have become an essential of human lives, 68% of Americans own smartphones. Some people use it for entertainment and others use it for education and work, but it can also be distracting because people can not put it away even while driving. Nearly 40,000 each year are injured or killed due to a phone caused car crash in the United States. Even though phones can be devastating, they can be used to contact emergency authorities during a crisis on the road, on the other hand they can be hazardous when used for any other reason like calling, texting, or anything else related to looking away from the road.

There is a four second interval between a phone related car crash, a phone rings the driver takes their eyes for at least two seconds to find it, then they answer it before looking back on the road, at this point it can be too late to prevent a fatal crash. The drivers sense of sight, hearing and hand coordination are temporarily lost. Driving is a serious and dangerous task, all attention should be focused on the road, so the individual can drive safely for themselves and other roadway users.

Using your phone while driving is basically like closing your eyes and taking your hands off the wheel. The driver can potentially harm roadway users around them like pedestrians, bikers, truck drivers, and motorcycles. According to the Association for Safe International

Travel, ""Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44.

Each year nearly 400,000 people under 25 die on the world's roads, on average over 1,000 a day."" Many of the crashes could have been prevented if drivers had full attention on the road.

Some of the newer cars are fitted with the handsfree mode where the driver connects their phone through bluetooth. This helps drivers decrease hazards if it is used properly, and there are now cars with autopilot. It helps to put your phone on do not disturb mode or putting it somewhere requiring you to stop and safely use it. Many states are now passing a strict no phone policy in cars, like Georgia if a police see a driver with a phone in their hand they can now be fined.

People have to become more responsible while in the cars, they should always remember to wear seatbelts, use their phone only when there of the road and parked somewhere safe. If used correctly phone can be useful for emergency situation on the road, but they can also be a danger for the individual and other people around them if they are used incorrectly.

Phone use while driving has become extremely common in this day and age. Almost everyone that's driven a car has done it, and they know it. A lot of people do it, but that obviously doesn't make it right. Of course lots of things have come out so that we won't have the phone in our hands while driving, but who said that having a phone in your hand is the only problem? Phones cause for distractions, accidents, and possibly even jail time.

The last thing that you want while driving is to get distracted. I think I could say the same thing for a passenger. Have you ever been in a car with someone and they start looking at their phone?

Have they ever got on the phone and laughed so hard that they close their eyes while driving? It's not a good feeling to be in a situation such as that cause you worry about your life. Hands-free calls are good but just because they don't have a phone in their hand does not mean a person still cannot get distracted due to the use of a phone.

Distraction due to phones could result in multiple things. One of the things it can result in is pedestrians getting hurt. In the state of Georgia, Pedestrians are given the right-of-way when crossing a marked crosswalk. Pedestrians are required to yield the right-of-way to oncoming vehicles when crossing the street without a marked crosswalk. If drivers aren't paying attention then they might just hit a pedestrian and it might just be on the driver. Drivers could be so distracted due to cell phones that they run a stop light and end up hitting a pedestrian.

One of the main reasons for car wrecks in the United States is not driving under the influence or speeding. The main cause for car wrecks in America is distracted driving. People don't realize how easily a person could get in a car wreck. Looking at a text or notification on your phone could take your eyes off the road for almost 5 seconds. 5 seconds doesn't sound like a lot of time but it really doesn't even take a full second for a car wreck to actually happen.

When using your phone while driving, you should ask yourself a few questions. Do I want to possibly go to jail today? Do I want to possibly crash today? Do I want to possibly take a life today? These are questions you should ask yourself before picking up that phone and reading that text or even talking to someone on the phone. Don't be selfish. Think about other people and the impact that using your phone while driving could possibly have on others. Put the phone down and get where you need to go.

2E98ECF2CA61,"PHONES & DRIVING

In today's day and age, technology has drastically increased. People now days seem to rely on their devices more than anything. People surely can't get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They look at the phone while walking, eating at a dinner table, or even in class while their supposed to be learning. But the main problem that is occurring is people texting on their phone while driving an automobile. This brings up the question if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In my perspective, I believe drivers shouldn't be able to use their cellphones while driving. For starters, you're taking your eyes off the road. This is extremely dangerous because it only takes five seconds (minimal amount) of your time taken away from the road for an extreme accident to occur. For example, if u is driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving.

Another reason that you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of ""answering a quick text"" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people's lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.

The last and final reason is that it's illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!

In conclusion, people shouldn't be able to operate a cellphone while driving a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. So please keep your eyes on the road and don't pick up the phone.    ",4,490,Phones and driving,Independent,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

D0CBBD43827C,"Should People Use Their Cellphones While Driving?

Over the year many states have banned using cellphones while driving. Some people tend not to listen and still use it and that causes a lot of people lives. Should people use their phone while driving? No one should be using their cellphones while driving. It's not safe for you, the person next to you, or the person that you hit, insurance rate goes up, and its illegal.

People thinks that they can use their phones while driving but end up causing people lives even themselves. In 2018 half a million people were injured because of texting and driving. In an article of ""Facts & Statistics About Texting & Driving (Updated for 2018)"" it claims ""With the latest statistics available as of 2018, in 2015, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Transportation, 3,477 people died and another 391,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes caused by drivers who were distracted because they were texting or using cell phones."" Don't let anything distract you from taking your eyes off the roads.

Depending on what auto insurance people have, when you get into an accident your insurance will go up. In an article ""Just how much does car insurance go up after an accident?"" it said that ""Insurers once followed the Insurance Services Office's (ISO) standard of increasing a premium by 20 to 40 percent of the insurer's base rate after an accident."" If you drive a brand new car that you pay for it, you wouldn't want your insurance to higher then your car bills. Specially if you are a young adult trying to figure things out, you will be making the worst mistake if you let your phone have your attention.

In most state it's illegal to text while driving. There are 41 state that ban texting while driving because of distractions. In the article ""Texting While Driving May Be Common, But It's Illegal In Most States"" it stated,

""In all but four of those states, texting while driving is a primary offense, meaning you can get pulled over and ticketed simply for that alone; in Florida, Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio, you can get ticketed for texting only if you were pulled over for some other offense, such as speeding. (By comparison, only 12 states, along with Washington, D.C., ban all drivers from using handheld mobile phones.)"" Don't get distracted and get pulled over because your friends or family is texting you. If anything it only takes a minute to pull over and do what you need to do. You don't want anything to happen to your safety.

Life is too short for anyone to risk it. Witnessing a distracted driver is very scary, life is never promised for tomorrow. Rethink about your choice, is it that important to risk anything? People are way too naive to know what's right from wrong, moral of the story don't text while driving.

E34D7384EE70,"Today, there are many controversial conversations on people using their phones while driving. Some People may think that phones should be allowed to be used for certain reasons such as GPS and other emergency uses while others believe that phones should not be used at all due to accidents and law violations. If people were able to use their phones and be a responsible driver at once, just maybe there would not be a problem with it nowadays.

Even though phones have caused a lot of accidents and deaths, I believe that certain uses of the phones should be allowed while driving. Sometimes, people get emergency phone calls and emergency text that they need to see in order to try and fix the situation if it is a fixable situation. Some people also have their phone for uses of GPS and other informational services. Not all people use their phones as a distraction while driving. Some people just need it at the time.

Even though i believe that using your phone while driving is a good idea, there are many cons to this idea. A lot of car accidents had to do with the involvement of teens and adults using their cellular device. Phones have cause a lot of deaths, not just in America but across the world. I believe there should be more laws made that does not ban phones but put restrictions on them like time restrictions. Example: A law that prevents you from using your phone after 8:00 pm or a law that prevents you from using your phone on certain streets.

All in all, i do believe using your phone while driving is not that bad of an idea as long as people can use it responsible while driving.

10F1B47C95E6,"Cell phones. Almost everyone has them but over the past couple of years have they became a issue where they have caused peoples life's. Many people find the time to be on there phones anywhere at anytime they want including while driving. People have been putting each other in danger just to see a text or a notification while not paying attention to the road this simple action can cause a person to lose there life.

Image a teenage girl first time on the road and is finally able to have her freedom and rights of driving. The girl is driving carefully and responsibly until she gets a notification from her boyfriend saying ""we need to talk"". The girl hesitates to answer the text message while she is looking back and forth from the road to her phone until she finally grabs the phone from the cup holder. She started to text back her boyfriend while running a red light and getting T-boned on her side of the car causing a crash. This is just one of the million possibility's that could happen while texting and driving. This is also a reason as to why under no conditions should a person text while drive. What if the girl didn't pick up the phone? What if instead she turned it off or pulled over onto the side of the road. A text message will be there forever but your life dose not.

Not only are you putting your life at risk but you are also putting other peoples life at risk. For example there's a man driving a truck and just got a text message from his wife he figures that since there is no one on the road nothing bad would happen so while he is texting while driving he dose not notices a boy riding a bike crossing the street he looks up from his phone and realizes whats about to happen and steps on the breaks on time. What if he didn't stop on time what if he kept texting. his actions did not effect him but it effected others such as that little boy. This is why for no reason should you text call or face time while drive it dose not matter how you do it you are still putting other peoples life at stake including your own.

In conclusion drivers should never text while drive because you are then putting your life and others at risk. If only drivers would think before they do something then maybe more people would be alive today. Maybe the girl in the car crash would be alive today maybe the boy riding his bike would be alive today. Driving is a privilege and a responsibility.

CC296299ABA4,"The use of cars and mobile technology has done nothing but grow in our society without ceasing. However, the use of these cellular devices while driving can be fatal to the driver and to others. If the driver is overly distracted and is not paying attention, it can cause them to veer off the road or hit innocent, bystanding, pedestrians. The use of technology could also be used for good. GPS helps most people on this earth, get to where they need to go. Although, this can also lead to them getting distracted, some apps have it, so that the driver can simply hear the directions. The usage of cellular devices shouldn't be restricted completely, but limited to using GPS.

The amount of car accidents due to drivers being distracted by their phones, is at 1.6 million per year. This is mostly texting and driving, or being on social media while operating a vehicle. Actively using phones while driving should be restricted because of the danger to the driver, passengers, and the pedestrians that are around. Most of the drivers that are making these mistakes, are teenagers that don't know better. Teen drivers, or new drivers in general, should take a proper drivers ed class, that'll teach them proper drivers etiquette. This will inform them of the dangers of texting and driving, and teach them techniques to avoid temptation.

Although the use of cell phones should be restricted, it shouldn't be completely prohibited. Drivers often use their phones for GPS in this day and age. If phones are permanently prohibited, then drivers won't be able to use their mobile map. It navigates the driver to where they need to go. Apps have been programmed so that drivers can use their GPS hands-free. They also input a feature that will speak the directions out loud so the driver doesn't feel the constant need to pick their phone up and read the directions. All the driver has to do is input their destination in before the vehicle starts moving. Phones while driving doesn't need to be prohibited.

Some people will argue that the usage of any phones can start any car accident. While that is true, it is highly unlikely and implausible. Although texting and driving is the cause of many car accidents, it's not the cause for ALL of them. Phones cannot be blamed for every car accident that happens. In fact, drunk driving is the cause for 31% of car accidents that occur in the country. Taking away the cell phone completely from use in the vehicle, will have a poor effect on the drivers who need GPS to go to new places and don't end up lost. It will lead to drivers needing maps, which are often hard to read and hard to keep track of.

Getting rid of cell phone use while driving completely, may seem like a smart idea at first, but it doesn't make sense once really contemplated. It would alter the country's way of driving, and not in a good way. Maybe there would be less accidents, but there are still drunk drivers to worry about. Cell phone usage while driving should not be strictly prohibited, but rather restricted for all uses except for GPS.

62644C50869C,"Cell phones and vehicle operation are simply two things that do not mix. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Research Shows that using cell phones while driving nearly doubles the risk of a negative outcome occurring. As mediocre as that sounds it could lead to fatal car crashes, Injuring a pedestrian or even punishment for distracted driving.

According to Edgar Snyder & Associates Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". The outcome of texting while driving is not that important to where lives should be taken to send a text if it's that important then why not just pull over. in the article on edgar Snyder & Associates it also states that 10 percent of all teen motor vehicle crash fatalities in 2016 involved distracted driving. The risk is increasing every time a person pulls out there cell phone.

In the article that was posted on USA Today it stated that ""U.S pedestrians death totaled nearly 6,000 in 2017 for the second straight year amid signs that walkers and distracted drivers do not mix.""Also it states that texting while driving is more risky in a urban environments. Teens that text and drive are more likely to get into an accident than an adult that is even though both are risky studies show that being young while doing it is worse than being older while doing it. The issue at hand is affecting everyone texting while driving or just being on your phone is a bad mix and innocent children and adults are suffering because of it.

Texting while driving can result in many punishments like Monetary fines, Criminal charges and jail or prison time. According to Legalmatch ""Texting while driving is a moving traffic violation and may be a criminal misdemeanor in certain jurisdictions"".

Also,Jail or prison time if the offense has resulted in bodily injury to another driver, jail or prison time may be imposed. The more you get caught texting and driving the worse the punishment will be it could start off with a simple fine and the next time you could be serving jail time. Finally, If you have been hurt due to someones else mistakes you are entitled to compensation at which you can sue them.

In Conclusion, Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The outcome of this can hurt the drivers mentally, physically and even emotionally (if they take someones life in the process).Texting while driving is now one of the most reason drivers are getting fined as technology advances peoples urge to use their cellphones are growing tremendously. It is not worth it to risk your life for a flash of entertainment that isn't going anywhere anytime soon there actually incorporating technology into the vehicles.

Driving with a cell phone is very common, yet very dangerous at the same time. This is because phones tend to cause a distraction among, not just teens, but adults as well. Driving with phones have become so crucial, it has become against the law to drive with a phone in hand. The leading cause of teenage deaths in America are car accidents. The fatal crash rate for teens is three times greater than drivers ages twenty and over. Having phone in hand while driving has made for numerous unfortunate deaths for people. The main cause is not being focused on getting to a destined location before picking up a phone. The situation has gotten so severe, the Apple company( made for iPhone), has taken matters into their own hands. They have created 'do not disturb' to detect when a person is in a moving car at certain miles per hour, to keep them from having any distractions as far as notifications or calls.

There have been inventions made to lessen the use of phones while driving, so as the phone holder and using bluetooth connected to a car. Though these things are helpful, it still can be a distraction while driving; as far as maneuvering to answer a call and inserting a phone into a phone holder. Driver distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. After reviewing this information, it's more favorable to not use a cellular device at all whatsoever while behind a wheel. By putting the phone down and taking small steps toward safe driving, even if it takes pulling the car over, will help lower crash/death rates around the globe. In conclusion, phones and driving do not coincide well, and should be prevented no matter what the cause is.

Your court day comes up either your license get suspended or you have to pay the person you hit money. It might end up as both. This why people should not text & drive.

7E29804EE125,"Today in society cell phones play a huge part in deaths because people use their cell phones while driving because they want to text, call, take pictures, and or even being on social media. As people continue to depend on cellphones for their communication needs these devices not only become more useful but also more dangerous, especially when people are using their phones at the wrong times. The most dangerous time to use your phone is when you are driving. If you use your phone while you are driving, you are taking a huge risk on losing your life or taking someone else's life. The action of many countries around the world to ban the use of cell phones while driving may have served to deter drivers from using their phones as they drive.

One of the main reasons that make using cell phones while driving very dangerous is that using the cell phone reduces a driver's reaction time in traffic. On busy roads, the amount of time that one talks before reacting to a situation in most cases determines whether someone gets to continue living. It is very dangerous to text and call while driving but texting while driving is more dangerous because the driver must constantly keep looking at the phone screen in order to type or read the messages. Studies show that people who text while driving tend to accelerate more slowly after stepping on the brakes, this can cause irregularities for another driver leading to possible accidents and since their eyes are more on the text than the road, drivers who choose to text while driving have a much higher chance of hitting a pedestrian than those not distracted in driving.

Many accidents, whether severe or not, usually occur within a blink of an eye. This means that just a moment of distraction is enough for a driver to cause a serious road accident.

Driving while being on the phone is very dangerous. No one should be operating a vehicle and using technology. It can ruin your life. People don't think before they do stuff and it doesn't always end good. You might think you can pay attention to the road and drive at the same time, but you never know until its too late. Many wrecks have been caused by people texting and driving. You could look up at the road one second too late and take someone's life.

Most teens are addicted to their phone and right when it buzzes, they grab it and check it. They can't even drive without them. You could swerve while on your phone, stop too late, or never see the person walking. Just like that someone's hurt and its your fault. Driving is a serious thing. You don't have to just worry about your life but the other peoples on the road's life too. Not everyone can see the same thing, so all your attention needs to be on the road.

That's why you shouldn't drive and be on your phone. Its very dangerous and can take someone's life. You never know when that day will be. You can never be certain on what will happen. That's why you should always be safe and not do it. Think before you take someone's life.

Before cell phones were invented car accidents were shockingly low compared to the numbers we see today. Texting and driving are six times more likely to cause an accident than driving intoxicated. Over 1.6 million crashes a year in the US are linked to cell phone distraction. There needs to be something done to stop this.

If someone is caught texting and driving, there should be a worse punishment than a small ticket. People are putting people in danger every single day doing this. Approximately 660,000 people are using their phones right now while driving. Texting and driving are considered the most dangerous activity to do while driving. Nearly 390,000 injuries a year are caused from texting and driving. Texting causes a 400% increase of distraction while driving.

Even people that text and drive want something to be done about it. 94% percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving, and 74% of drivers support a ban of hand-held cell phone use while driving. A AAA poll showed that 94% of teen drivers know about the cell phone laws and the dangers of doing it, and 35% admitted to doing it. 21% percent of all teen accidents are caused by cell phone usage. Teens are 4 times likely to get into an accident or a near miss than an adult when talking or texting on a cell phone. 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving in 2017. 15,341 people between the age of 15-29 have been involved in fatal accidents involving cell phone usage.

There is too much risk involving cell phones and driving, thousands of people die a year involving cell phones. If something can be done about this then many lives would be saved. Teens and adults put themselves and other people in danger every day just to look at a screen for a few seconds. Someone's life is more precious than taking your eyes off the road to look what someone said.

42048FB6EC2B,"Drivers should absolutely never be able to use a cell phone while driving. This is evident as in recent years there has been a big problem in our society with drivers using their cell phones while driving. It has gotten so bad that it has become illegal because driving while using a cell phone is more likely to be the cause of a fatal accident, than when a person drives under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Use a hands free device at all times while driving. I say this because a cell phone will take your attention off of the task at hand. A driver's focus should be maintained on only driving to ensure safety. It has been proven that driving while using a cell phone is the cause of more vehicular accidents resulting in a fatality than those caused by drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

In two thousand and thirteen there were three thousand one hundred fifty-four people killed in distracted driver related crashes. In just one year's time, there are three hundred and ninety thousand people injured in accidents caused by texting and driving. I personally do not use my cell phone when I drive, because it distracts me very easily. I suggest that drivers should be able to use their cell phone for an emergency purpose only. Even in a crisis situation, the driver should pull over to the side of the road before making a call.

I also encourage that the cell phone companies should be made to have the cell phone come from the factory to where if your cellphone is moving, it will not be allowed to ring or give you any notifications. In order to get your notifications, you will have to manually tell your cellphone to read that you are not driving for it to allow you to open the phone. It will then give you the notifications and or missed calls you have missed. In addition, it will not allow you to access absolutely any of your social media platforms or let you get social media notifications while you are driving.

In conclusion, my opinion on whether drivers should be using their cell phones while driving is that they should refrain from using their cell phone while driving. This is because driving is a task that requires a lot of focus and a cell phone is very distracting.

Driving while using a cell phone is now illegal because of how dangerous it is.

Losing your life over having a cellphone in your hand or trying to respond to a text that can wait is not worth your life. It is not that serious to ruin someone else's life and yours to send a text back to your homeboy saying your on the way. Stop signs maybe but while driving of course not.

Using your cell phone on the road is nothing to play with. Driving without a phone in your hand is hard enough. You have to focus on your surroundings and other people driving is hard enough. I think I can speak for everyone when I say stuff can happen right before your eyes. That means as soon as you look down to send a text back to your girlfriend you can be in a ditch or through a building as soon as you look up. I feel like there should be more technology that can help people use their devices on the go. But the way it is looking now in the world it does not need to be addressed at this moment.

Moving on, I feel like people should not be able to have their phones active while driving. And music should not be played loud enough to where they can't hear the outside world. Personally I don't like how people do that. It is dangerous to others and themselves. But more phone laws should be introduced because that is way too many deaths to be comfortable with. I don't want to be known at my funeral for being killed all because I was texting a friend.

InConclusion, phone laws are looked over in the country today. If we want to cut down on these deaths we need to take action on the little issues that are called cell phones.

Drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle, because there are several risks that could happen. For instance insurance rates will hike. Also, you are more than likely to have a wreck. Lastly, if there are people in the car you should always consider your passengers.

Your insurance rates are priced by a complex equation (Rate factors) which include: Age, Car make and model, Gender, Location, Driving history. Causing a car accident often leads to higher insurance premiums. Even if your rates don't go up after an accident, you could lose your good drivers discount.

Many of us want the right to text and drive in our cars, but study shows that texting while driving causes accidents. For the people driving older cars, texting while driving is a safety hazard. It's Now Illegal to Text while druving, due to the many accidents. Overall being distracted in any way makes you a worse driver than you would be if you were completely focused on the road. Also, talking to passengers can affect you driving skills, even though it's socially accepted and nearly unsafe.

Texting and driving puts all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk to. That's because, you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap. If you were to hit someone while texting and driving, more than likely you will end up in jail.

The best way to end texting while driving is to educate, especially our teenagers. Depending your age, you might already be considered a risk. Teens pay the highest insurance rates in the country, followed by the elderly seniors. Teens or seniors who cause minor accidents rarely get a break from their insurers.

Cellphones are becoming some people's addiction to the point they risk there life just to text. I think the only way you should be able to use your phone and drive is if your handsfree using it. Calling and music should be the only thing you should be able to do. There is no excuse to risk your life or anyone else's life just for a text message.

People are way too caught in their phone that they need to put it up when they drive. Georgia has passed a law stating your phone can not be touching you when in your vehicle. You may not even make a phone call unless your car has the hands-free option. I honestly think this is the perfect for people. It helps control people and make roads safer.

I believe you should be able to listen to your music on your phone when driving and even make calls, but texting should be off limits. You have to look at your phone to long and take your eyes off the road which is extremely unsafe this should be reason enough not to do such things.

In conclusion, its simple to not text and drive because you're safer you could just listen to your music or if you really need to tell someone something you could just make a call to them instead and be a whole lot easier and safer.

89808E74DDC5,"Cell Phone Usage while Operating a Vehicle

Many states have made the use of cell phones while driving illegal due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls and texting. Many states have also created laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. Cell phone usage has become the leading cause of distracted driving. Drivers can easily become distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car accidents. I agree with cell phones being banned while driving.

I believe that driving while using a cell phone should be banned because of the drastic increase in accidents. On one occasion, my mom was hit from behind because the person in the car behind her was texting on a cell phone. Fortunately my mom was not seriously hurt because the driver behind her was not driving at a high speed. If the driver in the car behind my mom was driving at a higher speed, my mom could have been severely injured or killed. Banning cell phone usage while driving enables a driver to remain focused and to keep the appropriate amount of distance between vehicles.

A driver can't focus on the road or other vehicles while consistently talking or texting on a cell phone. Studies have proven that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents.

Cell phone usage while driving has caused car insurance premiums to increase. My mom's car insurance increased an additional $15 a month this year. That additional $15 can go towards gas to get us back and forth to school, work, church, etc. Her car insurance agent advised her that rates have increased across the board; distracted driving was the main reason for the increase. I earned my learner's permit this year. My mom is afraid to teach me how to drive because of her fear of distracted driving. I will be attending a defensive driving school to learn how to drive. My mom is not looking forward to adding me as a driver on her car insurance because her premium is going to increase drastically.

She often complains about distracted driving contributing to higher car insurance rates. I don't bother my mom about teaching me how to drive for now; she takes me wherever I need to go. I'm about to graduate from high school, and it is my intent to attend college or go to the military. I have to learn how to drive very soon, but I'm really not looking forward to it.

Society has become more connected to cell phones more than ever. Cell phones provide a lot of convenience. From communicating with relatives and friends, checking emails, paying bills, taking pictures, recording videos, listening to music; you name it! However, talking or texting on cell phones while driving simply don't mix and has become a huge issue in the past few years.

Everybody has their own opinion regarding cell phone usage while operating a vehicle, but I believe that using cell phones while driving should not be allowed. Using a cell phone while driving has the driver focusing on the phone instead of the road. This increases the time it takes for a driver to react effectively. In case of an emergency; the driver should pull over in a safe zone and then call for assistance. The main reason for most car accidents in today's society is driving while using a cell phone.

I urge my family, friends and anyone reading this essay to take the ""AT&T It Can Wait"" pledge against distracted driving at ""www. itcanwait. com"". ""Join the millions who have pledged to drive distraction free.

From checking emails, to posting on social media behind the wheel, all of it can wait."" As of today, over 32,083,847 pledges have been made. Pledge now!

There are three types of distractions, visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distractions cause you to take your eyes off the road, manual distractions are anything that causes you to take your hands off of your steering wheel, and cognitive distractions are anything that causes you to take your eyes off of the road. Throughout the years, over 3,447 people were killed by distracted drivers. Drivers 20 years old or younger are more susceptible to falling into the ring of distracted drivers. With today's advanced social media platform a new and dangerous trend surfaced the web and went viral. The creators of the app ""Snapchat"" added a filter to the application that allows users to track their mph speed. This filter promotes distracted driving.

According to the Washington Post, Christal McGee, an 18 year old, was behind the wheel of her father's white Mercedes, on her way home from work on a Thursday night in September 2015, when she pulled out her phone and opened Snapchat. McGee wanted to try the filter out, so McGee, then accelerated some more, reaching 113 miles per hour on a suburban road outside Atlanta and the speed limit was 55. She didn't see Maynard Wentworth, an Uber driver just starting his shift that night, until it was too late. She hit him at 107 miles per hour. Wentworth suffered a traumatic brain injury and was hospitalized for months. McGee was sued and the infamous app was also sued for negligence.

The accidents and lives taken could have been easily prevented and still can. Drivers are encouraged every day to put their phones down when they drive to prevent accidents, but they do not take them seriously. A death of someone at the hands of a distracted driver could easily prevent many deaths. The choice of responding to a text message or saving someone's life should be of no ignorance. As of July 1st, Georgia's Hands Free Law was passed to keep cellphones out of people's hands as they drive.

If drivers' hands and eyes are not on the road at all times because they choose to be distracted by a cellular device, then proper precautions should be taken to keep them off the road.

Many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although, this may be a norm in our daily routines, some people risk their lives by using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle. By doing this, people can cause a hazardous driving experiences for themselves and others. The dangers can include, distractions that cause car accidents, property loss or even death. With the potential that phone usage and driving can cause so much harm, it should be a legal band to cease all cell phone usage while driving.

In 2018, the state of Georgia adopted the ""hands-free"" law. This law doesn't allow the phone to touch any part of the body while driving a motor vehicle. This means that any touching, texting, calling, dialing, reading emails, surfing the internet, recording, etc. are all banned while driving. Doing any of these activities cause distracting conditions that are dangerous and unsafe and can result in the driver straying, losing control of the vehicle, or crash.

According to NHTSA, 3,166 people died as a result of distracted driving, in 2017.

With this understanding, nothing on your phone is worth that much of your attention.

Death is a real possibility if the law is not taken seriously. In Georgia, there are about 4 accident related deaths per day and nearly 1,500 fatalities per year. A quick glance at your phone or taking your eyes off the road for as long as 30 seconds, can escalate to a lifetime of regret, pain, and sorrow for yourself or someone else's family.

This reason alone, should serve as enough rational to band cell phone usage all together or maximize the cost of fines for offenders of the ""hands-free"" law.

In the event, that there is an accident that is caused by violating the ""hands-free"" law or distracted driving caused by phone usage, it has unforeseen financial damages, as well. Although, insurance is meant to protect us, it's still at a cost. Each year it cost about $230.6 billion to United States residents for accident claims. This can place a heavy burden on any family that is under prepared for life's unexpected turns.

In conclusion, there are so many things in life that we cannot control that can result in financial burdens or death, we should ask ourselves is answering a text worth my life? I'm guessing its not but so often, we risk our safety to do just that. Not using the phone while driving is a behavior that can be controlled, especially, if we consider how important life, focus, and finances are. If we take the time to put the phones down while driving we can ""arrive alive.""

In today's society many phones have become an essential part of life. We use our phones everyday to talk, text, share pictures/ videos, and to use gps locaters. Although we are on our cell phones daily for various reasons there is a time and a place to use them. One time you should never use your cell phone is when operating a motor vehicle. The use of a cell phone can lead to many fatalities that can harm you or others.

Texting while driving can be distracting, dangerous, and can lead to a accident. Picking up your phone for even a second means that your attention is not on the road and can lead to a fatal even deadly crash. Texting while driving is a manual, visual, and cognitive distraction. Taking one or more hand off the steering wheel is an example of an manual distraction and not having both hands on the wheel can lead to you not having complete control over the vehicle. Not having your eyes on the road is an example of a visual distraction and can lead to you crashing into something. Lastly, texting and driving is an example of a cognitive distraction because you are not focused on the road.

Taking your eyes off the road can lead to a horrific accident that can cause harm to yourself or others. You should always be considerate of others around you whether its passengers in the car or pedestrians around you. Distracted driving means that while you aren't paying attention you could be crashing into someone and possibly taking their life. When looking down at your cell phone you aren't able to pay attention to what's going on around you nor will you be able to see a pedestrian. Will you be able to live with yourself knowing that you were the reason someone's life got taken away from them because of you?

In todays technology there are many alternatives to texting and driving. Cars now have wireless Bluetooth where you can answer the phone with a click of the button on your steering wheel. You can also speak your text messages so you don't have to look at your phone and divert your attention from the road. Even if you don't have a car with Bluetooth cell phones now come with a hands free feature and a do not disturb while driving feature. Manufactures are making it easier and easier to drive safely while also still being able to communicate effectively and efficiently with others.

In conclusion, texting while driving can be extremely dangerous and should never be an option. It can lead to accidents and will distract you from the road. Once you take your eyes off the road you are not only putting yourself in danger but others too.

Drivers should not use a phone unless they are using it as a navigational device to get to a destination. If used in any other way it is very dangerous and will cause serious accidents to them and other drivers as well. Driving while using cell phones cause major problems that could've been avoided if they weren't using a phone. According to statistics in 2018 9 deaths and 1,000 injuries per day have occured due to distracted driving

One problem that cell phones cause while driving are swerving off of roads while driving at high speeds. Swerving could cause other drivers to have accidents because they tried to avoid the person that was swerving. If they weren't on their phones that probably wouldn't have happened.

Another problem is self proclaimed accidents. Some reasons this happens is because the person was probably texting while driving and they took their eyes off the road. This is the most common problem that people have mostly among teen drivers. It is 6 times more likely to cause an accident if someone is texting and driving that driving under under the influence.

Playing video games on cell phones while driving is another problem because people often like to have some type of entertainment while driving. This could often cause road rage while they are driving because something probably happened and they got mad. Some app developers have started making video game apps that blocks a person out of the app while they are driving.

All of these problems that are caused by cell phones can be avoided if people use their cell phones wisely. Improper use of cell phones put their lives and other people's lives in danger. A cell phone should be used for specific reasons only if not then they should not be used at all.

On a daily basis the majority of people use their phone. Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phone while driving. Using your device while driving can cause car accidents, injure people, or even cause death.

Drivers should not be able to use their electronic devices while driving. Using your device while driving can endanger people's lives. People might make the excuse that they need to use their phone to use google maps but they could have done that before hand. Using a device while driving puts everyone around you at risk even yourself. One out of every four accidents are caused by texting and driving. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting and driving

In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones at all while in a vehicle. I think this, because even with these new cell phone laws some people still use their cell phones while driving. So with these laws it should make the chance of accidents less possible, and police can write tickets so people are less likely to do it again. Now, all new cars are able to have bluetooth and touch screen and unless you have a very old car that shouldn't be an issue anymore.

However, the reality is, most of the drivers are still using cell phones while driving and I guess it's not that easy for the police to catch them.

With bluetooth you just swipe to pick up a phone call and automatically connect to your car nowadays. Many people tend to think it's not a big deal to just swipe -it takes only a second. I do think so as well. That one second could cost you a life or somebody's life.

What can stop drivers' using cell phones while driving?

The simplest but most difficult is each driver has a strong will not to touch the phone during driving. Police can set more camera (not only at the traffic lights but on normal roads) so that cameras can catch drivers who are using the phones. Once ""Restriction on cell phones while driving"" law becomes nationwide, cell phones should be made to get disabled near the driving seat once car starts moving.

I will follow the law once I start driving and hope all the drivers consider about the risk of using the cell phone while driving.

Texting and driving is something common a lot of people do now a day. There are so many problems with cellphone usage while driving. Many people think it's okay to use their phones while driving, but I personally think it is not okay for people to text and drive. Some people rather risk their life's than to be careful about their surrounding and how one car accident can cause so much damage all because that one person wanted to be on their phone. It doesn't just have to be texting it can be in general by just being on your phone. People get way too distracted by cellphone usage.

Cellphones make a big impact on people, who knew that cellphones can be that addicting. It doesn't matter where you are you turn your head and you see someone on their phone because it is so addicting. It almost like having a coffee addiction. When you see people crossing a cross walk you insatiately see a phone in someone's hands and half of the time there not looking at where there going they just walk and walk until they run into somethings. Cellphones are a huge addiction in today's society for everyone including teenagers. You see cellphones almost everywhere you going. You will be shocked about how many people use their phones a day.

When you're driving and you're on your cellphone is really risky. It can cause many problems as in you cashing into someone else or you can go off the road and get in an accident. There have been many different accidents because people want to be on their phone and not focus on the road. Texting and driving can many deaths as well. People die of being in car accidents when the driver is texting. People don't look on the outside of how many tragic thinks can happen in a blink of an eye. It can be life changing too because you never know what can happen or go wrong. Many people don't know how much damage can happen. People die, vision lost, no arm, no leg, an arm, etc. none of this is replaceable but every material thing can be. That's what people don't understand. People need to be careful of their surroundings and, be careful who you have in the car.

People have habits of looking at their phones once they hear a ring. They right away have to go see what it was or who it was. That's where the distraction comes from and that were people get into trouble with officers or car accidents etc. because they get distracted by the ring of a phone. There is always pros and cons about things people being on the phone. Some of the pros are if you have the sound on it is always good for important in the case of an emergency. You always have something on the side or if someone else calls you and it is an emergency. Some of the cons is that people use it for other purposes which is to text, snapchat, twitter, Instagram etc. and they think they can multi task but some people can't. That's why it's better to put the phone down and let social media wait before there is an accident.

It's better to save your life and some else's.

Being safe is one on the most important things. A text message or video call, snapchat, Instagram is not worth you in bad conditions or you causing a death to yourself or to someone else. Phone are becoming to be more addicting by the day and you would be shocked about how much technology has gone up. Keep all eyes on the road never look down and stay focus.

I believe that despite the good that comes out of phones, they also have some serious cons when it comes to driving. 11 teens each day die due to using their phone. Not only are you risking your own life while operating a vehicle while texting, you're also putting other people's lives in danger. Using your phone while driving is a distraction no matter what the situation is. You also never know if the person in front of you could suddenly stop so having your phone out could lead to an unnecessary crash. There are a few reasons why cell phones shouldnt be used while driving. There are just so many dangerous things that could happen that are associated with the use of a cell phone and driving.

Driving decreases the amount of attention you have on the road which increases the amount of crashes. If you are driving 60m/h your car is moving 16 meters per second, so just a few seconds that you dedicate looking at your phone could result in a serious crash. Just reaching for an object like your phone is just as dangerous. The act of a conversation is also still a distraction. The act of a conversation creates a depth of though which takes away from the attention you should have on the road.

Luckily today we have things like apple carplay which you can use for urgent situations which reduces the amount of accidents. Over all, phones should not be used while operating a vehicle and if the situation is so urgent then it's safer to just pull over and take care of the situation. Doing that will reduce the amount of crashes each year. If we learn to prioritize the amount of things done while in a vehicle then it will save so many lives. We all need to understand the real dangers we put ourselves through along with other people while using our phones or any sort of technology while operating a vehicle. Technology has a lot of pros but many cons when it comes to driving with another distraction.

In my opinion, while you are driving you should not be able to use your phone. You are putting your life in danger as well as others. Phones are a big distraction while driving and if you don't have some type of bluetooth system in your car then you should not be on it. Cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands.

Holding a cell phone to your ear, or having your eyes diverted from the road by logic and common sense the driver is distracted. If an emergency maneuver or emergency braking is needed a driver has a second to react, and a split second to execute the appropriate maneuver to avoid a collision. Picture doing this with a cell phone in your hand. Those who are caught will be issued a ticket by a police officer who will probably be quite perturbed at the driver's ignorance and poor decision after witnessing the devastating effects of texting and driving at accident. A text message that reads ""ok"" isn't worth a couple hundred dollar fine.

However, people shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

BCAD86B8E5AA,"Phones and Driving Essay

All around the world people are constantly trying to decrease safety risks. Driving has become one of those risks to safety. Since cellular phones have grown to be popular. People often use them everywhere and in their car is no exception. At first this was great. You could be on a work call while you were on your way home. Or you could be checking to see if anyone else wanted food where you were eating at. Although this has brought much convenience, utility and entertainment. It also has brought great risk to safety while driving. Drivers become distracted and make more mistakes than usual. Causing more accidents. There is a big discussion over whether you should be able to use your phone while driving or not. I believe that phones should not be allowed to be used in cars.

One reason that cell phones shouldn't be allowed is simply because you can last the car ride without using it. With the exception of an emergency of course. If something is important than you can pull over and make a call while getting gas or something. And everyone would be better off paying less car insurance. Also, if you have kids and display that you don't value safety, then they may follow and do the same and even worse.

Another reason is that it puts everyone at risk including themselves. If everyone was on their phone while driving. We would probably have close to double the amount of accidents. Just for a little convenience. Studies show that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol.

Humans are smaller and less noticeable than vehicles, making the likelihood of seeing a pedestrian much less than that of a car. And hitting a ton car is different than hitting a pedestrian. The pedestrian would likely die if you were going fast enough.

In conclusion, simply because the downsides outweigh the upsides. You should not be able to go on your phone while driving. Because of the distraction that it causes. ANd its impact on our awareness of our surroundings while driving. It's a safety risk and for the most part only has downsides. From hitting cars to hitting pedestrians, the risk is not worth it as it puts many lives at risk.

A86B97324E7F,"Texting and Driving

In the society of today, everyone is easily distracted when they get a notification on their phones. Which can lead to some funny stuff like running into a pole or a wall. But it can also lead to the end of someone's life.

The average person drives 70 mph on the highway, and if a person were to look away for 5 seconds they would have traveled 102.7 feet. That is more than a quarter of a football field. By that time anything could've happened that would lead them to an accident. Each year, over 390,000 accidents caused by texting and driving leads to severe injuries such as broken bones, neck and back injuries, traumatic brain injuries, etc. For example, in 2013 a 22 year-old man named Alexander Heit flipped his car and rolled for a while. He died while typing a text to his friend.

Because of all the deaths and injuries caused by texting while driving, most states in the United States have made laws to try to make the road a safer place. The first offense you will be charged with a misdemeanor and can get a ticket that ranges from $25 to $50 and one on their driver license. And it just gets worse from there on out if they continue violating the law. But if you were to kill someone while texting and driving, you will be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter and can spend up to 20 years in prison. Although all of these precautions have been made, accidents are still growing.

The states of Missouri and Montana do not have laws to regulate texting while driving even after all of the accidents caused by it. I honestly think that there should be harsher laws for people texting while driving. It so saddening to hear that someone lost their life over a text that could have waited till later. Something needs to happen so that all of these deaths stop.         ",4,335,Phones and driving,Independent,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

69975DF9F871,"Cell Phones were invented in 1973, however, they weren't owned by the public until the 80s. Phone usage grew quickly after the first two decades, and now over half of the world population owns a phone. Considering cell phones haven't been around for a long time, they have become a main part of our lives, and we rely on them for simple daily activities. The growth of cell phones could be from how easy it is to reach someone within seconds no matter their location. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: phone calls, sending text messages, emails, surfing the internet, and performing other tasks. But unfortunately, many of these daily activities also occur while a person is driving. As a result, there's an increase in accidents and fatalities because of the use of cell phones while driving. Cell phone usage while driving should be banned because it's a distraction, causes erratic and aggressive driving, and is the main cause of accidents.

While driving, total concentration and procedures are needed, and using a cell phone compromises the focus needed. When driving both hands should be kept on the steering wheel because it has been proving more effective. However, when you're on the phone you don't have both hard on the wheel. Even though some people use bluetooth headsets it still affects your attentiveness. Using a phone while driving causes drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel, their minds off the road and the surrounding situation, and take their eyes off the road.

When driving you shouldn't have any distractions such as cell phones, because they can cause a change to your driving pattern.

Because using a cell phone while driving is such a distraction, it can cause the driver to drive erratically. Being on the phone may cause the driver to fail to give the right signals, miss road signs, or respond slowly to situations. These patterns can be very treacherous to others driving and pedestrians. Cell phones can also change the drivers' behavior depending on the conversation or what the driver is doing on their phone. Drivers experiencing emotional or stressful conversations may behave more aggressively, possibly causing road rage and accidents. Even though most drivers believe they can multitask, many of them are getting distracted and their driving patterns are changing, causing them to have accidents.

Many accidents are caused by those using their cell phones while driving. There are about 1.6 million accidents caused by phone use, which is roughly six times more than accidents caused by drunk drivers. In 2011, it was reported that 23% of all car accidents each year involve cell phone use. The National Safety Council reports that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the

U.S. is caused by drivers using cell phones. Leaving about 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by being on the phone while driving. Cell phone use causes many accidents because of the distractions it causes and should be illegal to use while driving.

Cell phones have quickly spread and became a major part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything, making us rely on them heavily. However, we are using phones while driving, which is causing an increase in accidents. Phones cause distractions and could change the behavior of the driver. Because of cell phones being used while driving there have been about 390,000 injuries each year. Therefore, we should ban drivers from being able to use their cell phones.

326B272D36A0,"Do you feel that it is safe for someone to have their phone while driving? I believe that that there are reasons why you should and shouldn't be able to have your phone while driving. For example one of the reasons i believe that driving and being on your phone is dangerous is that many accidents can be caused. By that i mean when being on your phone you have no time to pay attention to the road. When driving your attention should be focused on the road at all times when looking down on your phone you can't tell who or what is coming at you, which is a easier way to cause you and or someone else to be injured.

Another reason i believe that it is dangerous for you to be on your phone and driving is because this is now another way to get arrested. By this i mean now if you're riding with your phone in sight the police is liable to arrest you. By doing this you're risking your freedom. Not only are you risking your freedom you're also putting others in harms way. By this i mean what if someone is walking in the cross walk and you happen to be on your phone and accidentally hit someone then not only is that more charges but that's also you injuring an innocent bystander.

There are also good reasons why you should be able to have your phone while driving. For example when going to a place and not knowing the directions your phone has a built in navigation system to help you get there. You don't always have to have your phone in your hand you can buy the stand where your phone can sit on that way you can see both your phone and the road.

So it isn't always bad having your phone while driving.

Another good reason to have your phone while driving is because what if there is an emergency and that is the only way someone can contact you, you don't have to hold your phone you can always get Bluetooth and or wireless headphones. By doing this you are preventing accidents from happening and your also preventing yourself and or anyone else from being in danger. Not only that but you are also able to focus on both the road and the situation that may be happening.

These are the reasons why i believe that having your phone while driving is both a good and bad thing. There are many more reasons why but these are my main three. By stating these i hope that people take caution while using there phones while driving. Now that reasons are listed i hope that people look out for themselves as well as others.

E9C903DB3C85,"I think we all can agree that driving is an important part of life. Driving is what gets us from point a to point b. We drive vehicles on a day to day basis. It's what gets us to and from our jobs. The downside to driving is that it is becoming unsafe. There are so many people in the world that dive cars and own cell phones. The population is growing which means more and more cars are hitting the road every day. So, the question is, how can we make driving safer?

New laws are being created on cell phones and driving. One of the familiar changes is that now you can't be touching your phone at all while driving and it can't be in your lap when driving. Some say they don't like this new law because it means they can't check their phones for emergencies. The law didn't say you couldn't keep it in the car or their glove department. So basically, that problem is solved. I think this Law is fine how it is and that it is a good law to cut down on cell phones and driving. People shouldn't be able to see their phone while driving. It should be somewhere in the car out of their eyesight. That way they won't be tempted to text while driving.

Texting and driving can get both people killed that crash into each other.

You could be driving and doing nothing wrong while another person is texting and driving not paying attention to the road and they could end up ending your life.

Texting is not the only problem with having a cell phone on you when you are in a car. Some people say they use their phone for navigation. This could also be a distraction. Many phone companies have touched down on this problem. In fact, the newer model phones now can speak the directions to you while you're driving. That way you won't have to look down at your phone.

People often like to bring up that sometimes they get important calls while driving. There's also a solution to this problem to. When you are receiving a call, you can pull over to the nearest stop and then receive the call. People then like to ask what if you are on the interstate. There is no law that says you can't pull over to the side and make or receive the phone call. So, yea you should be able to use your phones while driving but keep note there is a right and wrong way of doing this.

With such an important impact that helps what people do in all fields of work, it is no surprise that people use phones wherever they go. Another important inclusion in a person's everyday life is a car, which is also used by people everyday, though cars have proven to be a lot more dangerous than a phone if a person is not paying attention to the road. Many accidents have happened as a result of people not paying attention to the road and this is exactly where a phone comes into play. As previously mentioned, phones are a part of a person's everyday life, and with that much involvement with a phone it often tends to follow people to them while they are driving their car. When people are on their phone while driving, their chances of getting into an accident greatly increase. Though it may seem harmless at first, operating a phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should not be allowed.

""Car crashes happen every minute of the day"", according to the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA). According to Teensafe, ""Distracted driving accounts for approximately is 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities...58% being teens."" Ironically, teens use phones more than adults as they are more involved with social media websites and apps. Teens, unlike adults, are also more inexperienced at driving, making the act of them using phones even more dangerous than adults. With all the things that people have to pay attention to on the road, it is almost impossible to do both at the same time.

""Sending or reading a text causes drivers, on average, to take their eyes off the road for five seconds,"" according to Teenlife. Anything can happen in one second when a person's eyes are not on the road, imagine what could happen in five. Whenever a person uses their phone, their chance of being in a crash increases by twenty-three. There are three types of distracted driving and texting fits all three types which is visual, manual, and cognitive. Using a phone causes a person to take their eyes of the road, take their hands off the wheel, and to take their mind off of the road. Because texting can become all three types of distractions, it's arguably the most dangerous action to participate in while driving.

Once again, phones have become a major part of the human life, and as a result, people constantly use their phones. Whether it is to check a text or watch a quick video, it is very dangerous to even attempt this while in a car. Operating a phone or any brand or size should not be allowed while operating a vehicle. Using a phone while not driving is not safe and has proven to be deadly. Hopefully, people will learn not to text and drive and be safer on the road.

As adolescents become more reliant on technology, so does their strong need to multitask as well. Many believe multitasking benefits one to become more efficient and accomplish more tasks. Although this sounds good in theory, the outcome can produce multiple errors. The constant shift of attention causes drivers to keep their eyes off the road, which leads to constant pullovers. In addition, the driver can exceed the speed limit and not be able to see stop signs or traffic lights. This will lead the driver into an unwanted accident and cause confusion and delay among drivers.

In conclusion, one should not text while driving because it jeopardizes the lives of others, it will get you in trouble with the law, and impairs one's judgment. Such reckless behavior will only make the driver feel nothing but everlasting guilt and regret.

Many people claim having a phone while driving isn't dangerous. Nowadays accidents happen due to cell phones. We live in an age when many of us are excited by a call or text that we can't wait to answer. Texting while driving is a hotly debated topic that often divides opinion. It goes without saying that driving with a mobile phone is one of the most important issues facing us today. The following essay takes a look at both sides of the argument.

To start with our population on reasons why accidents happen are because of cell phones. First of all, it is worth considering that phones shouldn't be allowed on peoples hands while driving. Secondly drivers must have their phones on a phone holder to prevent getting pulled over and prevent an accident. Thirdly you must be focused while driving if you have passengers on board because you're putting their lives at risk. Therefore you shouldnt be holding your phone.

Another factor to consider is not just your cell phone but anything that distracts you like food, advertisements etc, can cause an accident. Last but not least that text or call can wait.

According to experts, more than 3,000 teens die to texting while driving. Research has found that driving while texting is six times more dangerous than drunk drivers. There are those who argue that phones should be allowed while driving. For example if an emergency occurs and someone is trying to get a hold of you, you would need your cell phone to stay in contact. Another example is if you are lost you can call someone for directions. There is always a solution to everything like having a car holder and putting gps rather than calling someone.

Although most drivers are in the age of driving, teens aren't supposed too. Teens have led to one of the reasons accidents happen. Despite the fact that they aren't supposed to be driving they are very irresponsible. On the other hand, adults are supposed to teach their kids the right way to drive, to always drive focus never look at other accidents deals in the street while driving always look ahead. However teens should drive with an adult past 7 pm.

As far as im concerned, we should always drive with a phone holder to prevent an accident. From my point of view accidents happen due to several other reasons but mostly because of our phones. Weighing both sides of the argument people have their own opinion on whether or not cells are distracting. My opinion about cell phones while driving is very dangerous, we shouldn't be allowed to grab our phones while driving. Now in georgia it's illegal to hold your phone, part of a sweeping hands-free law. Also to be careful on the road, you might run someone ever, you never know cause most people j walk. Whenever you go out on your car remember to put your phone on mute.

Over the years technology has done nothing but advance forward with time. Resulting in two of many of society's most used technology; automobiles and cell phones. Cell Phones were created to make communication a lot easier, as well as mobile. So that one could easily contact or be contacted anywhere at any point. With vehicles it was somewhat the same deal, Find an easier, and quicker way to travel. Individually both inventions are credible to society, but is it safe for drivers to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? No, it is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.

In order to use a phone your eyes, hands and attention must be on the device, looking through apps or sending messages can be very distracting while driving. Distracted is one thing one should not be when operating a vehicle, distracted driving can result in an accident which can either seriously injure or kill someone. When it comes to accidents caused by distracted driving the numbers are higher amongst teen drivers. In this generation teens are addicted to their phones and social media, it is harder for them to find a disconnect even when driving. ""In 2017, nearly 40 percent of high school students reported texting or emailing while driving."" ""Distracted driving is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. In 2015, 391,000 injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents. In that same year, distracted driving was cited as a major factor in 3,477 traffic deaths."" These statistics further prove how a cellular device should not be in use while driving a vehicle.

While using a phone when driving is extremely dangerous there is an alternative to using a device while operating a vehicle, bluetooth. Some people who have business related occupations may already have a bluetooth earpiece, but car manufacturers are now including bluetooth systems inside their cars. This feature allows one to connect their phone to their car, so that they can easily answer the phone by clicking a button on their wheel, and the car can read out sent text messages. One can respond by using voice typing, this allows people to easily answer phone calls and text messages without having to physically take their hands off the wheel. Minimizing accidents caused by distracted driving, talking on the phone and thinking on how to respond to a message can still be distracting and remove focus from the road. Therefore, even using the Bluetooth feature can be a cause of an automobile accident.

Overall, neither phones or alternative phone systems should be used while operating a vehicle. It is too distracting and the effect of one simply answering a text or phone call could be their or another driver's life.

E527586F851C,"Having a device near you while driving is very dangerous and a huge distraction. There are many consequences if you get caught driving with a cell phone. It distracts you from paying attention to your surroundings and you could hurt yourself or others around you. It is also against the law.

The U.S department of transportation reported that cell phones are involved in 1.6 million vehicle crashes each year. It has caused half a million injuries and around 6000 deaths annually. Texting while driving is even more dangerous than driving while under the influence of alcohol. People should put their devices down and focus on the roads and surrounding cars.

Everyday around 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving. It only takes 3 seconds for a crash to occur after a driver becomes distracted by their cell phone or anything else. Holding a device while driving slows their reaction time by 49%. Car wrecks have killed nearly 32,999 people yearly and injuring around 2,239,000 people.

As of July 1,2018, in Georgia the ""hands free law"" was passed. The ""hands free law"" means that drivers will no longer be allowed to have a phone in their hand or supported by any part of their body. Texting while driving is highly illegal and it's good to see the state's law being put in to action.

We should not text and drive. It is overall a distraction and could lead you to death or you could kill an innocent person. The laws are very strict about texting and driving now. It's good to see the cops pushing the law so hard on people and if you don't listen then you suffer the consequences.

Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things a driver can do. It can cause major and serious wrecks. Why do people wreck when texting and driving ? The people who text and drive do not concentrate on the road or their surroundings.

Texting and driving is so common for causing most teen wrecks. Teens are new to driving and have little to no experience. Adding a phone to the mix is just a recipe that will cook disaster. It's not just new drivers who wreck from texting and driving its new ones too.

Everyone who texts and drives is putting themselves and others at risk. If you wreck due to texting and driving you will be held liable.

5F1CF4B91975,"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Every day, people die in car accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. A message or a phone call can affect how much attention a driver pays to the road.

Every day, people die in car accidents because of the usage of their cell phone. According to research cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents today. But, despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to always stay in touch with other people.

Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to a car crash. For example your boss calls and it's not a good conversation and you eventually get upset. This 1 conversation can lower your driving ability that 8could then lead you to lose control over the vehicle and cause you to crash. So if drivers don't make a decision to put away their phones, their routine can harm innocent people.

My opponents may argue that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free technology doesn't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and it may make it worse. Research show that using headphones can be as dangerous as holding a phone because conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road.

In conclusion, if people don't give up cell phones, the number of fatalities on the roads will continue to increase. It is the drivers responsibility to not danger their and others people's lives.

Driving while using your phone shouldn't be allowed. There's people who are more afraid of getting hit by a distracted driver than getting hit by a drunk driver. Even though they are making new laws to help distracted driving it's not enough to solve this problem. People break laws all the time just because you make the one touch rule doesn't mean it solves the problem. Now the day enforce this rule and start finding or revoking people licenses.

The dangers of distracted driving are very high. This is a serious matter people are dying every day because of distracted driving. 3,166 were killed by distracted drivers driving in 2017. At Least 9 people are killed every day, and more than 1,000 injured daily from something as little as a phone. I would expect a bigger cause to so many deaths; people don't understand that driving while on the phone is like the butterfly effect. One flap of the wing and it could destroy someone's life.

Driving with a phone could destroy someone's life in a matter of seconds, you can destroy your own life in a matter of seconds.

Driving while on your phone can ruin your life in a matter of seconds. More than 481,000 drivers are currently using their phones while driving. Even though there's all cellphone ban in 21 states and one touch only ban in 48 states people still use their phones. Two seconds is all you need to crash your car no more or no less. It's that easy and people don't realize that a snap of the finger you could be dead. It takes two seconds to not see that motorcycle or two seconds to not see that child crossing the street. Even if you yourself are not injured you can really do some damage to a person that's not in a car. You have protection of your car the person walking has nothing, but themselves.

People need to wake up and stop smelling the roses. What will it take? How long will it take for you to change your ways? What will it cost you for you to realize that putting your phone down for a 10 min drive vs putting your own life or someone else's life down for ever is more important. Not even one tap should be allowed because that one tap can also cost lives. People should have their licenses revoked for driving while on the phone. This is no accident this is manslaughter; it's an accident that could be avoided. 8/10 times a call or text message is not that important that it costs death/injury.

F425F44374DD,"Cell phones have not been around for a long time but, they have become an important factor of our lives. People use their cell phones for everything like texting, talking, event planning, social media, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at a time. Sadly, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they're driving. Holding your phone in your hand while driving is dangerous to the for many of reasons.

When it goes off whenever they're driving whether it's a text, social media or a call, curiosity gets the best of them and they feel as if they have to look at that very moment. To stop and read this message you would have to take your eyes off of the road longer than the time of the one second, it takes to look at the rearview mirror. It is very dangerous to type or read while driving. It isn't safe on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.

I think that the use of a cell phone while driving should be banned in all states because it is already against the law in some states, it is a distraction to drivers. The use of cell phones, in all ways, while driving is already illegal in twelve states across the country. If someone is caught using their phone while driving, drivers may be faced with a ticket and a fine. The first California cell phone law bans any cell phone or wireless phone use while driving and if you are under the age of 18 you are banned from using a hands free device. The cell phone laws do not affect passengers of the vehicle; this law only applies to the driver of the vehicle.

Handheld cell phones can only be used if there is an emergency. Cell Phones and Driving In today's society we've all become attached to our cell phones. it does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be banned and against the law.

First with texts, social media and any written phone alert.

Cell phones make our lives easier in many ways we can check our email, receive phone calls, send text messages, listen to music, and take pictures, all at our fingertips. With all this convenience, however there is a dangerous side to cell phones, and that's when we use them while driving.

ABAE2E36B9D0,"Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years because almost everyone who drives has one. Cell phones are use in cars more than there suppose to. In my opinion you shouldn't be able to use cell phones in a car and heres why.

1 reason drivers should not be able to use a cell phone is because they want pay attention to the road and they could hit another car or even a person. Also if drivers don't use a cell phone why there driving they can make it to there destination safe and they can get on it when there done driving. Drivers who use cell phones put a lot of people in danger cause there not checking there surroundings and pay more attention to there phone then the road.

A lot of car crashes are caused by cell phones because people are always on them. Also when people are driving they should put there phone on do not disturbe or in driving safety mode until there out the car. If drivers did that there would be less crashes and we wouldn't have to worry about cell phones.

There would be less crashes if people didn't have a cell phone in a car because the driver would be focused not only on the road but focused on there surroundings to.

5613F9FB2154,"Phones & Driving

The first reason why you should not use a cell phone and drive is because it is inconsiderate of other drivers. When people use their cell phones on the highway or on a city road, their driving tends to become pretty lousy. Examples of this are shown in various ways such as someone pulling out in front of your vehicle, not letting you merge into an adjacent lane, the driver ahead of you slowing down to text or call, and not acknowledging other drivers and pedestrians at intersections and parking lots. When a driver slows down to text or make a phone call, they are taking their attention away from the road, which is one of the most common ways to end up in an auto crash. No text message or phone call is worth a rude action on a highway or city road much less an auto accident. It is not good to use a cell phone while driving because it can cause you to not let another car merge into a lane, pull out in front of another vehicle, slow down, and for a few other reasons too.

The next reason why it is bad to use hand-held devices and drive is because committing these actions causes more automobile crashes, as my other discussions have already indicated. Why is this? It is because using a cell phone while driving distracts the driver causing him/her to look elsewhere. Some may be attempting to dial, text, or talking on their cell phone, but nevertheless it still distracts the driver. Because of this distraction, drivers are more prone to end up in an automobile accident. Just as if a distraction might cause you to lose a point in a tennis match, a distraction on the road could cause an automobile accident. Another reason why not to use a cell phone and drive is because there are alternatives to cell phones that are less dangerous. For example, the earpiece is a device that fits on your outer ear as you might have guessed and allows you to have both hands on the steering wheel while you answer a call. With the push of a button, a call can be answered while you can still be driving safely. In conclusion, you should not use a cell phone while driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, because it is illegal, it causes more automobile crashes, and because there are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you regularly answer calls or texts when you are going shopping, to work, to a friend's house, or whatever you may be doing, consider the consequences. What is more important? The text message or your life?. If you are pulled over texting and driving, you will be issued a fine. However, if you are texting and driving and you cause an accident, there may be criminal consequences for those actions that could result in jail time. Nowadays, there are many apps available to drivers to deter them from texting while driving Something very important is that many of the states have started to pass some laws that order drivers to stop texting while driving. However, we need to be sincere: none of these laws will be effective if we as a society don't understand that texting while driving could have terrible consequences, not only for us as drivers but also for other innocent people. I don't think that answering texts is more important than the lives of other people; texting can wait until drivers arrive at their destination.

In 2018 there were 4,637 deaths caused by distracted drivers. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle, it increases the risk of accidents, causes deaths, and overall the act is irresponsible.

Well, Iets say you're going out of town and you need to use the gps? Most cars nowadays use modern technology, and there's a thing called Bluetooth. Having the option of Bluetooth in a vehicle allows a phone to connect to a car wirelessly. Which would ultimately allow distraction-free gps. Cell phones are helpful, but can be highly unsafe, while operating a vehicle.

Is Bluetooth actually any safer? Setting up Bluetooth can be as easy as one, two, three. Look for your cars manual and it should have directions on how to set up bluetooth from your phone to your car. I believe bluetooth is safer because you would be allowed to have hands free control over your phone. This essentially removes the problem of operating your phone while driving. You will only have to set up bluetooth once, so once your phone is paired there is no undoing it unless you please.

In conclusion, I don't think people should be allowed to use cell phones in their vehicle to any extent if it's unavoidable. People who do so not only are putting themselves at risk but other people's lives as well. Bluetooth is a great alternative to minimize the use of cell phones while operating vehicles. Most cars nowadays have this option. For people who don't have this option, i advise that you not only think about yourself, but as well as other people, when using your cell phone while driving.

Today, the majority of humans in the world own and use cell phones everyday, however no person should be allowed to use their cellular device while operating a vehicle. These vehicles include trucks, sedans, vans, heavy machinery vehicles, bikes, etc. The use of a cellular device while operating a vehicle serves as a major distraction to the driver; even if the driver only looked at the phone just a second could call for a fatal result. Thousands of people die every year due to cell phone use while operating a vehicle, however fatalities, as such, could easily be avoided if drivers would wait until they're no longer driving to check their phones. Texting and driving can be as dangerous as driving intoxicated, driving under the influence, for you reaction time is weakened due to the distraction of your phone. A good reason to not text while driving would be that it takes only a few seconds to park your car, if looking at your phone is that important. With how today's cellphones are made to draw the user in, it is imperative that drivers make the smart decision to just wait to use their phones.

When texting while driving, you are more likely to end up in a wreck rather than going about your day. According to https://www. netsafeutah. org/teens/staysafe/distracted_driving. html , ""Drivers on the phone have worse reaction times than many drunk drivers."" this is important because when you look at your phone while driving is like the equivalent to driving with a blind fold on, and the time it takes the driver to look back at the road from looking at their phone is the same amount of time that it would take to take the ""blindfold"" off. According to https://www. nhtsa. gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving,

""Texting is the most alarming distraction. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed."" It only take five seconds of a distraction mistake to result in something that can catastrophically change your life forever, and not in a good way! In all consideration, as a driver, if there is a high need to be on the phone just pull the car over. Although it only takes five seconds of distraction to end in a crash, it takes just a few seconds to pull over safely.

Why risk the consequences of using a phone while driving to begin with? Although the results of using a phone while driving may very, the odds still are not in your favor! As the driver you not only risk your own life, but you also put other lives in your vicinity at risk. According to Jim Forsyth, a Reuters reporter, ""The typical reaction time without texting was between one and two seconds, but while texting it increased to three to four seconds, regardless of whether the driver was typing or reading a text."" (https://www. abc. net. au/science/articles/2011/10/06/3333955. htm). When it comes to driving reacting and timing is everything, but when a driver gets distracted it is almost inevitable for something bad to happen. When driving there is already so much happening on the road, so much that there's not much room for error, that those two seconds of reaction time are key to preventing a car crash. There are so many rules and laws to driving a motor vehicle, however the easiest, of all the rules and laws, is to not text while driving. In fact if a driver always follow this rule, they could be considered a superhero for all the lives they save by not putting others at risk because they did not text and drive.

Is texting and driving at the same time dangerous? One must not have a brain to think there are no risks to texting and driving. Sure, everyone has done it, so why not? Everytime a person texts and drives, they put themselves and others on the road in danger of ending in a car accident or worse death. Don't text and drive, because doing this you will save lives!

While using a phone and driving is common, it can also be very dangerous. That is why people should not be allowed to use their phones while driving. There are other reasons why phone usage should not be permitted while a person is driving.

One of the reasons a person should not be allowed to use their phone while driving is that the risk of getting into a car crash is raised. Those who text and drive are 23% more likely to be in a car crash than those who do not text and drive. In 2016, 3,450 people were killed in distraction-related crashes.

In Georgia, drivers are not allowed to touch any kind of electronic device with any part of their body. This law has been put into effect because of the more than 1,500 deaths from distracted driving in Georgia in 2016.

People should not be able to use their phones while driving. The use of phones behind the wheel puts many lives at risk. Many states have already banned the use of phones behind the wheel.

912B8D2E3228,"Consequences for texting and driving.

In recent years there have been many studies conducted on how texting while driving is dangerous and the negative outcomes that usually happen. I believe nobody should operate a cell phone in any capacity while driving. One reason that you shouldn't use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you aren't considering other motorists. If you're too busy texting or talking you become distracted and you aren't concentrated on the road anymore. So many car accidents are caused by texting and driving. According to Georgia's driving statistics there are 3287 deaths each day from distracted driving. Texting and driving is illegal in the state of Georgia. On July 1st 2018 they made a law and it says ""all drivers operating a motor vehicle on any highway of this state is prohibited from holding or supporting..."" you know it's a pretty serious situation if the entire state of Georgia made a law about it.

Texting and driving also set bad examples for kids and other people. Often when you are operating a vehicle you have other passengers like young kids and teenagers. You don't want to text and drive in front of them because they may start to think that's the right thing to do. Kids tend to mock behaviors that they see others doing and if the mock the texting and driving habit those type of accidents will never stop. Due to texting and driving teens are 400 percent more likely to get into an accident. Teen drivers being distracted by cell phones is the number one killer in teenage deaths. With teens being so inexperienced with driving they need a completely focused and structured driving zone so that their full attention is on the road and nothing else.

Did you know that texting and driving slows your reaction time? Researchers at Texas A&M transportation conducted a ""how your reaction time is affected"" project. The normal reaction time without any distractions was one to two seconds, when you're texting and driving the reaction time number shoots up to four or five seconds. You may think ""oh whatever four to five"" seconds isn't enough time to cause any damage"" and in reality, if you're not paying attention for one second a lot can go wrong especially behind the wheel. Finally, one accident and your insurance goes sky high. Why would you want to pay money for something this is preventable? Texting and driving is pretty easy not to do. If you feel like you absolutely can't keep your hands off the phone there are tips to help with that. One thing you could do is put It inside of the glover department so that you can't reach it. One last tip that you could so is have a passenger (if you have one) to hold your phone so you can't get to it.

Now think about it...is texting and driving worth it? All the things that could go bad if you are distracted and driving should encourage you to drive distraction free. I think in order to prevent all these accidents among teens especially is to have cars that blocks out service so that phone access is completely impossible! Now that you've read this will you change, or will you continue to make the same careless decisions? Texting and driving accident percentages can go down if we all try to stop.

077DD935321C,"Phones and Driving

Over the last few years there have been many records of death and/or Injury from being on your phone and driving. There are many laws in place to stop this act from happening, but just like with everything else, there's no way to fully stop it. Many people have different opinions on the subject. In this essay I will be explaining the two sides; good and the bad. How dangerous is it to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time?

Six thousand people die each year in the US due to texting and driving. Cell phone use should be prohibited why you operate any piece of machinery. Things malfunction and can go wrong with your full attention on them. Don't give any room for error. You aren't only putting yourself into danger but everyone else around you as well. Anything you do besides watching the road and focusing on your surroundings is putting your life at risk. Anything can happen in two seconds without your eyes on the road. Think about how many times you almost got into an accident due to someone else not paying attention, but you're fine because you were. A phone takes that away from you.

There's not a good side to texting and driving. They've made many alternatives to not having to touch your phone while driving but still being able to operate it. We all have a virtual human on our phones who tells us directions or calls who we want based on us saying things like, ""Hey Siri."" They make phone holders for your dash, but that's sill dangerous because you shouldn't take your eyes off the road anytime the vehicle is in motion. Everyone uses a cellphone while driving because they feel like they must be in a rush to get a text sent or etc. It isn't safe to be distracted by anything while driving let alone something so addicting already like a cellphone.

In conclusion, trying to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time is dangerous and life threatening. It takes one second to not be in an accident because you were too late. Just one second could change so many lives, and impact many more. You should stay focused on the road and arriving to your destination. That one missed phone call can be returned, and if not pull over somewhere safely and stay parked until you're done messing with your phone. Don't operate a phone and drive. The road requires your full attention.   ",4,423,Phones and driving,Independent,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

F959259025C9,"Today many people are on their phone & driving at the same time. Cell phone use while driving has led to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries have been occurred from accidents caused by texting and driving. In my opinion, driving without phone use will decrease the percent of crashes around the world. Phone use is one of the reasons of car crashes occurring.

Answering a text takes at least 5 seconds of your attention away. That can be enough time for you to collide into another car or a car colliding into you. Even answering a call could take most of your distraction away from you seeing where you are driving. It would be safer to use the cell phone when you come to a complete stop or when you have reached your destination.

94% of teens that drive acknowledge the danger there can be by texting and driving, but 35% admit to doing it anyway. Teens are a big percent more likely than adults to get into a car crash or almost crashing into another car or anything that is in your path due to talking or texting on the cell phone. Also the amount of teen passengers doubles the risk of car crashes, because they are young & they like to use cell phones. They are even more of a distraction with all of the hype & noises.

263 teens (age 15 to 19) were killed as a result of distracted driving in 2016. The rate has increased throughout the years. If you can wait until you come into a complete stop or if you can wait until you reach your destination, please do so, because it will decrease the risk of crashes around the world.

2B0696776BFC,"Should Drivers use Cell phones while driving?

What would we do without the latest technologies in our daily life? We use computers for work and in school, we use cell phones to access apps and do research. At home, we use microwaves to heat up food and landlines have been replaced by cell phones as the main phone of many people. In our daily lives we use cell phones to text, look up boarding passes, check flights and make phone calls. More and more, people are using technology, including cell phones, as an important part of their lives. As more and more people become dependent on the use of cell phones, some of the time they are being used may be in a car, while driving. Is the cell phone more helpful or hurtful when they are used by drivers in a car?

While a small minority of people do not have cell phones, the prevalence of cell phone ownership and use has increased. ""Cell phone usage is becoming a mounting issue in the United States with 91% of Americans (97% of people between 18-24) owning cell phones and using them for texting, calling and communicating for personal, work and school in daily life."" (""Cell Phone ownership""). Cell phones are so in trend with their convenience and popularity they seem to be increasing in numbers and not decreasing. ""Eighty-one percent of Americans own smart phones up from 35% in the 2011"" (""Mobile Fact Sheet""). It seems that more people are becoming dependent on them, despite the potential risks. For teens, texting has become more popular as making a phone call. Starting in the year 2001, State governments have started creating laws to limit cell phone usage by individuals driving in cars, as risks arise.

Despite the controversy there are benefits of cellphones especially for teenage students, who are now using new technologies during the school year. Cell phones are becoming more popular in school as a learning aid. ""In a recent poll 94% of students use their phones in class for learning"" (""Cell phone use""). The Majority of U.S. students are now relying on cell phones to get their school assignments and homework done. Since these teens have the cell phones in their possession, as they drive to school, they may be tempted to use them, both texting and calling, while they are behind the wheel. The benefits of this immediate communication with others and the convenience it creates, it may be outweighed by the risks and dangers of this usage.

In contrast to the benefits for cell phones, the dangers of distracted driving are real. Starting in the 2000's, States have started to restrict the use of cell phones while driving mainly due to the incidence of car accidents involving a driver using their cell phone. The fatalities do not just include the driver, but also the passengers and other victims. ""Twenty states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have hand-held cell phone use bans and thirty-eight states ban all cell phone use by novice and teen drivers"" (""Distracted Driving Laws""). ""Cell phone use while driving causing distracted driving has been linked to automobile accidents and fatalities"". (""Distracted Driving Laws""). The increase in accidents associated with cell phones is still controversial and there are arguments on both sides as far as the causes.

Some surprising emerging data shows a benefit of cell phones is their use in emergency situations. ""Patients are more likely to survive when emergency services are called from a cell phone rather than a landline"" (Weinlich). ""It is associated with improved mortality rates at the scene of medical events"" (""Mobile Phones proven""). Drivers may use their cell phones while driving to report an emergency. As more people continue to use cell phones more people may be able to helped and potentially saved in emergencies. Is the risk of distracted driving worth the potential benefit of helping someone in distress?

In addition to the risk associated with distracted driving there is another health risk associated with phone use. ""Cell phones give off a form of energy known as radiofrequency (RF) waves."" (""Cell Phone Safety""). And while this risk occurs whether the person is driving or not, it would be another reason for the driver to adhere to the handsfree laws. The concern has been a link that shows increasing risk of brain tumors of the head and neck while the driver holds the phone to the face (Creagan). ""The evidence is mixed though and there is limited evidence linking cell phone radiation to human cancer"" (""Electromagnetic Fields""). The mounting risks and seeming benefits for the driver are numerous and careful consideration must be used when considering using a cell phone while driving.

Overall phones have changed society for the better and for the worse. Since their introduction, the cell phone has significantly changed how people talk and has increased the convenience of personal communication. But the life-changing benefits of the cell phone come with many controversial risks. The negative effects of deaths from distracted driving along with other health concerns cannot be overlooked. Many distracted cell phone driver accidents occur with young teenage drivers actively using their cellphones while operating a motor vehicle. While these events may make the evening news, they will never bring back the special life of that driver, the passengers or others that may have been hurt or killed. More private and government agencies need to further expose the dangerous links of driver cell phone use to human health. There is a great need to further educate the public of these risks. Having these agencies along with Hollywood, TV and social media, where images and messaging catch teens attention, could positively educate drivers and shape what safe cellphone usage looks like. This positive action may ultimately save lives.

AA994A6CAF65,"Phone & Driving

It has always been a big concern on being on your phone, while driving. There are many bad outcomes from being on your phone while driving. You could possibly swerve off the road, crash into someone, or zoning out and not knowing what is going to happen next. Many people repeatedly still be on their phones while driving, while knowing what the outcome could lead to, and still not caring. Phones are a huge distraction while driving and no one seems to care what happens after.

Being on your phone while driving is not something that should be normalized. It can lead to one major problem, which is having an accident. When it comes to car crashes, and the cause of the crash is someone being distracted, is never a good look on the driver. Many people can lose their life, they can come out alive from the accident, but can still be traumatized to the point where they do not want, to ever get in a car again. 26% of most accidents are from texting while driving.

Another cause of being on the phone while driving, is a possibility of swerving off the road. No one ever wants to experience being a car alone, and next thing you know your trying to get back control of your car, from not being focused on the road. The outcome can be bad to the point where, you do not know where you are, may have lost your phone, and have no way of getting out because you are stuck. There have been nearly 390,00 accidents, caused from swerving while being on your phone. This could all be avoided if you just stay of your phone.

Finally, you could zone out, while on the road. When you are driving, your focus is the road. Zoning out while driving, and your phone can be a pretty ugly situation. You could possibly be intoxicated, and not knowing why, you on your phone and get carried away and zone out for a quick second, and next thing you know. You are in an accident. There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone.

To sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.

D15D74E790E7,". Phones & Driving

While using your phone anywhere sounds like a fun idea, it may not be the brightest idea... while driving. Technology is definitely a stepping-stone for all entertainment as a whole. Back then, in a not so distant past, people had to find things that entertained them, like objects around the room. There honestly was not much to do. Then came the commercial distribution of the home television. Eventually, almost every home in the country had at least one television. At that point, people could watch films and shows from the comfort of their home, instead of getting dirty or injured outside. Many years later came the technological advancement of telephones, known more modernly as smartphones. Smartphones were definitely a huge step in technology, because now you can take your entertainment with you. However... it may not have been the best thing.

Obviously, with this sort of convenience, people developed a way to multitask while using their smartphones. However, when something requires your utmost attention, like driving, that would be when you should probably put the phone down. However, using Bluetooth to answer calls is highly acceptable. The main problem at hand is looking at your phone while driving; it is a safety hazard. Now, there are pros, just as there are cons.

Texting while driving is now just as illegal as not wearing your seatbelt in Georgia. That does not mean you cannot use your phone for other things though. Cell phones have many different tools that can help you. Like a compass, or a clock, or especially a GPS. Obviously, you will not need a compass unless you are following a map in your car. The GPS, however, is a perfectly good example as to why using your phone while driving is a good thing. All you do is enter the address/coordinates and you just follow the route, while occasionally checking your screen to see if you are on track. Perfect for multitasking in the car.

Now onto the cons. There are excessively too many cons for you to even consider using your phone while operating a vehicle. The amount of distractions and casualties the problem creates should be more than enough to convince you to put your phone down while driving. Not only are you putting yourself at risk by doing this, but also anyone else who's near you on the road. So many people are injured and/or killed every year because of someone's poor decision to multitask, when their hand should be on the wheel.

To sum it all up, it can be both a blessing and a curse. You benefit from using phones and driving in some ways, but also risk harming others in the process. Texting while driving is not worth more than your well-being. If you are going to bring your phone, at least be smart about it. If not, you might end up like every ""texting while driving"" story; dead or severely injured. Just... think about it.
